Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
Up,Cardi B,"Up, up, up (Ayy), up (Uh), up, look (This is fire)

Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""

¿Podemos quedarnos despiertos toda la noche? A la mierda el jet lag
Traes tu buen culo y tu bolsa de viaje
Sume los números o apóyate en eso
Juega y rebobínalo, escucha, encontrarás eso
Quiero ese seis y nueve sin Tekashi
Y quiero tu cuerpo y lo hago obvio
Despierta a los vecinos, tenemos audiencia
Ellos escuchan los aplausos, pero nosotros no los aplaudimos
Seis en punto, estoy aplastando
Luego llegan a las siete en punto ahora lo quiere
Cuando dieron las ocho en punto, dijimos: ""A la mierda""
Olvida a tu chica, finge que soy ella
Ven a hacer ronronear al gato, ven a hacer que me duela la espalda, ayy
Haciendo ese chorro y lluvia y ducha y rocío
Ahora eso es perfecto, cariño, no dormimos lo suficiente
Pero te mantendré despierto, si puedes seguir así (bebé)

Haz que los dedos de sus pies apunten, bailarina, sin tutú
Baby, soy el mejor, no sé lo que hacen los demás (ayy, ayy, ayy, sí)
Sumérgete en el agua como una isla privada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco, podemos sesenta y nueve
Y he sido una chica mala, pero este coño en la lista buena (buena lista)

Good Days,SZA,"Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need

Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand

8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me"

Good Time,Niko Moon,"We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', ""Hey Y'all""
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time
Tryna catch a good time (Good time)

Holy,Justin Bieber ,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"
Best Friend,Saweetie ,"That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks

Fresh blow out, skin on ten, ooh, she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my mothеrfuckin' friend
She been down since thе jellies and the bobos
Now we steppin' out the Jeep in Manolos
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, ""Bitch, guess what?
All the rich-ass boys wanna fuck on us!""
All this ass sittin' up, you could look, don't touch
In our bag, bussin' bands every time we link up

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch

If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot, said, ""Mm-mm, don't go there""
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air

Fuck it up in the mirror, hit them poses (Hit the pose)
Best friend, you my motherfuckin' soulmate (Soulmate)"
Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Lonely,Justin Bieber & benny blanco,"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely"

Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
Down to one
I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""
Down to one
Down to one"
Without You,The Kid LAROI,"You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

Laugh Now Cry Later,Drake ,"Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?"
Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know

Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem

And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby

How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

Beat Box,SpotemGottem ,"Let go
(D— Damn E, this shit exclusive) Stretch gang
Face shots to the face, don't trip on your lace
Mafia

Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big four shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sense
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobe, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, bad lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan today, got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"
We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

Fumez The Engineer"
Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Clouds,NF,"(ورس 1)
کم کم کارام بهتر میشن
اولاش رقت انگیز بود، چیزی راجبش نمیگم
صدای تشویق به گوش میرسه
عزممو جذب کردم
میکس تیپ کاره من نیست، و ساختش خسته کنندس
ساختن اهنگ طولانی، سخت و پر استرسه
که تصمیم گرفتم با خایه بشم
نتیجشو داری میبینی، حالشو ببرید
مثل همیشه، رپر همیشگی اینجاست، پس اخماتو باز کن
بدنیا اومدنم موثر بود، جاه طلبم، یکم بدجنس، آره خودمم
غیر هنری، غیر واقعی، شوونیسم(برتری دادن)، من اینا نیستم
پیش میرم، پُربار، با متن های مرموز، سریع، سرکش،
سلطان شرارت، آرتیست تک، هر کسی نمیفهمه،
متعهد میمونم، مستحکم، آره
اهل تقلید نیستم، اگر خوشت نمیاد، چون گوشت تلخی. استثنا قائل نشدن، مورد علاقمه
درست شدن معماها برام، مساوی با به تصویر کشوندن بی تمدنیم، با ایجاد کمی نا امنی، آره درسته
ساده و واضح، شکننده نیستم، شکست ناپذیر، حواست هست؟
من بروس ویلیس تو لاشه قطارم(اشاره به فیلم شکست ناپذیر در سال 2000) ،انگار که بتونم ماشین رو با جت تعویض کنم، انگار رییسی ام که ناراحته چون ازش حقوق کمتری خواستن، انگار که با گردن شکسته بخوام کله پا وایسم، انگار که بگم اولین قدم زدن های بچتو دیدم، انگار که بگم بیل گیتس نمیتونه اجارشو بده چون ورشکسته هستش، چی دارم میگم؟ شدنی نیستن، غیر قابل تصورن
هم منطقی هستم و هم میتونم لجباز باشم، اگه مجبور بشم همه چی رو میگام، دوست ندارم از راه ساده بترکونم و موفق شم، اون چیزی که فکر میکنی نشدنیه،
من صد بار انجامش دادم، صد بار،
ممکنه مرزها رو جابه جا کنم، ایده ها نجومیه، بعضی اوقات طنزشم میکنم، آره کارام غیر قابل مقایسه هست،
هر چقدر گوش کنیش خسته نمیشی،
انتخاب بیت شاهکاره، غیرممکنه بتونی جلومو بگیری،
ساعت رولکس گرون قیمت دستم نمیکنم، با آدمای متقلب نمیپرم، جایزه ای نداشتم، نمیدونم چرا خدا منو انتخاب کرد،
یک چیزی تو لیوانم هست که کدئین نیستش،
بهم گفتن استایلتو عوض کن، حالا الان منو رفیقشون میدونن، آروم بیاین پشتم
با کی شوخی میکنی؟ چطور بهم شک داری؟
من همیشه تحویلش دادم(اهنگامو به موقع بیرون میدم)، نمیتونی به مهارت من تو رپ کردن برسی(بازی با کلمات میکنه درباره دندون عقل و دانش که یک کلمه هستن)،
اولش تو فکرم بود که صبر کنم، اما چی بگم؟ باید یک سر بهتون میزدم، رو به راهین؟
سال گهی داشتین؟(بخاطر کرونا)، اره میفهمم
گوش به زنگن تا آهنگم بیاد، کل صنعتو بلرزونم و شوکشون کنم،
این اهنگ مثل شهاب سنگ بیرون میادش، با برخوردش به زمین ازت میپرسه آماده ای یا نه؟
کسی مثل من نیست، بهترینم، جلوم کسی نیست، بهتره بهم احترام بزاری، وگرنه جسدتو لگدمال میکنم،
باشه اعتراف میکنم که یکم اغراق آمیز بود،
هر بار که پامو رو زمین میزارم مثل بعضیا قیافه ماتم زده نمیگیرم، بعضی اوقات منو با یک اوشکول تپه دیگه اشتباه میگیرن،
زمین به رعشه افتاد، بیا از بحث خارج نشیم،
حتی اهنگ های کمتر دیده شده ام هم حواسشونو به خودشون پرت میکنه که چطور از پسش بر اومدم؟،
بعضیا میگن من تاثیرگذاری بالایی دارم، من در این باره نمیدونم، اما من بهترین کاریو که میتونستم انجام دادم
(ورس وسط)
هالیوود، هالیوود
امیدوارم همیشه خاکی بمونم و سیس نگیرم
تو هم فکر میکنی که منو خوب نمیشناسی(در کل یعنی من یک ادم ساده هستم)

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see

I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets

La Noche de Anoche,Bad Bunny & Rosalia,"Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar, sé que sería tu debilidad

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no está' a mi la'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o

Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)

Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Yo encima de ti, tú encima de mí (Oh-oh)

Que yo me iría otra vez pa' Japón (Hey)
Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (Mmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (Yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón
Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (Bum)
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabe' que solo lo hago de leyenda (¡Wuh!)
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su Messiah
El Benito es un diablillo y es un ángel
Lo tengo juquea'o como si fuera tote
Baby, entre nosotro' nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice: ""Ella to' los récords bate""
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no está' a mi la'o

Sand In My Boots,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

This helps make a gathering cheerful and friendly

It ain't my fault, so don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks, it ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me

There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

I keep my cool, play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full

It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Aw, yeah)

I went and got a new one

I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)
The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things (Let's do it)
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing (Woo)
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene"" (That's right)
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene (Scene)
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (No, they not NSYNC, no, they not NSYNC)

Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
No, they not NSYNC, no-no
No, they not NSYNC, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"

Finesse Out The Gang Way,Lil Durk ,"(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

I came from nothin', I had to go get it
I had to finesse out the gang way (Gang way)
I done did everything for the niggas that I love
Who stuck in the chain gang (Chain gang)
Shit be so weird, I'm steady watchin' all the niggas who yellin' out, ""Gang, gang"" (Gang, gang)
Shit be so different, I'm watchin' them niggas who bitches but yellin' out, ""Bang, bang"" (Bang, bang)
Roll up a blunt of that Pluto
Used to be deep, now I'm riding 'round uno
I know some niggas who hustlin' but quit
'Cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers
But now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much
To me, it felt like you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out the side of my granny crib
I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers, ""Don't know what a Patek is""
Now it's two-tone

The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
Asked them why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30 like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas being goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' 'round with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bagged up with fifty one-hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call the dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (Got me in my feelings)
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?

Man, I've been trappin' since 2007
My mama was strugglin', I had to help her
From juvenile to penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy I can say I got it together
Fifty-three percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a gangsta, I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like businessmen
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bows to my brother 'nem
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama, ""We need a bigger house""
I'm too real for this shit, I done figured out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (Mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (Out)
I ran it up to a low from an ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought
I ran it up in this motherfucker
Three hunnid shots, that's enough in this motherfucker
Only The Family, it's us in this motherfucker, gang shit
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?"
Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view
A Hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A Hell of a view"

Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that

All these tattoos on my fuckin' body, she say I'm a hottie
Why your girlfriend always wanna fuck me, wanna touch my body?
We got all type of fuckin' guns, might even have a Tommy
I remember them days in the jail, still free my nigga Rodney
And free Chris though, 'member we was bouncin' out with .44's
A nigga keep it silent, in L.A., I keep a clip, though
'Cause no, I can't be lackin' in these streets, I keep a big pole
And I can't have no nigga with me if they gon' snitch on us"

Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it

Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof

Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down

Afterglow,Ed Sheeran,"(One, two)

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow"
Cover Me Up,Morgan Wallen,"A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good"

We can't live 'em if we stay the same
And I can't do this for another day

But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"

So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me

You've been making me feel like I'm

I Hope,Gabby Barrett ,"I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand

You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me

Better Together,Luke Combs,"A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here"

Holy,Justin Bieber ,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"
Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
Anyone,Justin Bieber,"Dance with me under the diamonds

Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future

Forever's not enough time to (Oh)

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time

I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

(You know I got a lot to say)
(All these voices in the background of my brain)"
The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"
Lonely,Justin Bieber & benny blanco,"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely"
Cry Baby,Megan Thee Stallion ,"Real hot girl shit

That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Her friends and mom hate me (Go)

Keisha? (Kei), Jasmine? (Jas), Kiera? Megan? (Go)
Lisa? Ashley? (Ashley), Sierra? Sarah?
She got her hands on her knees with her ass in the air, ooh, that lil' bitch a player
If her friends ain't around to record it, she bend over, shake that lil' ass in the mirror
Like goddamn, what a nigga gotta do for your number?
Shawty came through with that head so good, I said fuck it, I ain't usin' no rubber
Way she make that ass bounce, think I love her
Got that ass and that mouth from her mother
Type to make your bae mad, you in trouble
NBA playoffs that ass, it's a bubble
Uh-uh, uh-uh, come here, come here, uh-uh
Throw that ass back, come here, come here
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Her friends and mom hate me (Go)

Damn, he probably wanna wear my hoodie (Ah)
Choke me, spank me, look at me, thank me (Thank me)
If I give it to another nigga, he'll hate me (He'll hate me)
Spit, slurp, give him that work
Fell too fast for me, now the nigga hurt
Deeper, deeper, I need a reaper
Thought I was in trouble how he tearin' them cheeks up
Keep me a freak, who the flavor of the week?
If I make up the rules, then I don't think it's cheatin'
Jordan, Tommy, Timothy, Daniel (Which one?)
Might let Jonathan bring in Sarah (Come here, Sarah)
Bitch tryna brag about taking my man (Huh?)
Hah, I needed me a nigga off my hands (Hahahaha)
Uh-uh, don't fuck me like that, fuck me like this, yeah, ayy
His friends and his dad hate me (Yeah)
I broke his lil' heart, he a crybaby (Wah-wah-wah)
If I ain't let him hit the pussy by now
Then that nigga lame if he still waitin'  (Ah, ah, ah)
I ain't even save your number (Nope)
So no, I can't reply to no text (No text)

Probably why my shit so wet (Ah, ah, ah, ah, wah, wah, wah)"

What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?"
My Head And My Heart,Ava Max,"Baby, now and then
I think about me now and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh woah

My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite if I can't decide, baby

My head and my heart are torturing me, yeah
Lost my mind in your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run, and monsters call it love, oh

Damage,HER,"I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wilding, I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image"
Laugh Now Cry Later,Drake ,"Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?"
Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?

Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

Goosebumps,Travis Scott & HVME,"I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah

Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light

I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote

Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby

Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
La Noche de Anoche,Bad Bunny & Rosalia,"Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar, sé que sería tu debilidad

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no está' a mi la'o

Que yo me iría otra vez pa' Japón (Hey)
Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (Mmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (Yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón
Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (Bum)
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabe' que solo lo hago de leyenda (¡Wuh!)
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su Messiah
El Benito es un diablillo y es un ángel
Lo tengo juquea'o como si fuera tote
Baby, entre nosotro' nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice: ""Ella to' los récords bate""

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)
You must want another nigga to be alarmed (What you want see?)

Say you following your heart, but girl you leaving one
Wanting me to take you back with open reaching arms (And I can't do that, mama)

Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass

Sand In My Boots,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge

It's a Hell of a view

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"
Only Wanna Be With You,Post Malone,"You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Cowboys make me cry

But there's nothin' I can do
I've been lookin' for a girl like you

You look at me, you got nothin' left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance and you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring

But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you asked me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
Shе inhеrited a million bucks and when shе died, it camе to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Cowboys make me cry

But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you"

'Cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers
But now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much
To me, it felt like you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out the side of my granny crib
I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers, ""Don't know what a Patek is""
Now it's two-tone

The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
Asked them why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30 like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas being goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' 'round with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bagged up with fifty one-hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call the dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (Got me in my feelings)
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?

Man, I've been trappin' since 2007
My mama was strugglin', I had to help her
From juvenile to penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy I can say I got it together
Fifty-three percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a gangsta, I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like businessmen
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bows to my brother 'nem
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama, ""We need a bigger house""
I'm too real for this shit, I done figured out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (Mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (Out)
I ran it up to a low from an ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought
I ran it up in this motherfucker
Three hunnid shots, that's enough in this motherfucker
Only The Family, it's us in this motherfucker, gang shit
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues

Hole In The Bottle,Kelsea Ballerini,"There are many people who drink in moderation with no problems
Social, moral, or medical
They have learned to enjoy liquor without letting it upset
The functioning of their body and mind
It relaxes you, makes you more congenial (I just had one sip)
This helps make a gathering cheerful and friendly

It ain't my fault, so don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks, it ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me

There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

I keep my cool, play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
But I won't cry about love gone wrong
'Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sipping on
There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Aw, yeah)

I went and got a new one
'Cause the other one was broken
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open

There's a hole in the bottle (Hole in the bottle) leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

You may ask me where it's going
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home

But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I

Cover Me Up,Morgan Wallen,"A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom

Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong

Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I–"
Wants And Needs,Drake ,"(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen"

To get you under my pressure

To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
""The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino""
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure"

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"

Came from a bitch who nigga wanna fuck on me

Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)
I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train (Skrrt)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga

I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)

I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time

So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

Puedes pensar que soy loca
Por la forma en que he lo estado deseando
Si lo digo claramente
Solo dame bebés
Entonces, ¿qué haces esta noche?
Ojala que digas: ""haciéndolo bien contigo"" (Sí)
Tocando películas pero no veremos nada esta noche (Si)

No quiero mantenerte despierto (Despierto)
Pero muéstrame, ¿lo puedes mantener erecto? (Erеcto)
Porque luego tendré quе mantenerte erecto
Mierda, quizá te mantendré despierto
He estado tomando café (He estado tomando café, café)
Y he estado comiendo sanamente (Y he estado comiendo sanamente, sanamente)
Sabes que lo mantengo chirriante (Sabes que lo mantengo chirriante)
Ahorrando mi energía (Si, si, ahorrando mi energía)

Fóllame hasta la madrugada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco (Si, si, si, si)
¿Puedes quedarte despierto toda la noche?
Fóllame hasta la madrugada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco (Si, si, si, si)
¿Podemos quedarnos despiertos toda la noche? A la mierda el jet lag
Traes tu buen culo y tu bolsa de viaje
Sume los números o apóyate en eso
Juega y rebobínalo, escucha, encontrarás eso
Quiero ese seis y nueve sin Tekashi
Y quiero tu cuerpo y lo hago obvio
Despierta a los vecinos, tenemos audiencia
Ellos escuchan los aplausos, pero nosotros no los aplaudimos
Seis en punto, estoy aplastando
Luego llegan a las siete en punto ahora lo quiere
Cuando dieron las ocho en punto, dijimos: ""A la mierda""
Olvida a tu chica, finge que soy ella
Ven a hacer ronronear al gato, ven a hacer que me duela la espalda, ayy
Haciendo ese chorro y lluvia y ducha y rocío
Ahora eso es perfecto, cariño, no dormimos lo suficiente
Pero te mantendré despierto, si puedes seguir así (bebé)

When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first

What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Back when country wasn't cool?

Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
Better Together,Luke Combs,"A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here"

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría

Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo"
Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

No relations, feeling, fighting
Grip like pliers, I feel it tighten
Girl, I got plans for you, got a couple bands for you
I like the stance on you, good mouth got me like, ""Ooh, ah""
Ooh, ah-ah, ooh, ah, ah-ah
Lovin' the, lovin' the mouth
Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho
I love the way you walk, love the way you talk
Let a young nigga come play in your throat
Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke
Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you
Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you

Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light

My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile

Straight fallin' in love, right there that night

Holy,Justin Bieber ,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"

I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wilding, I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image"
Long Live,Florida Georgia Line,"Yeah, it's a Friday night, we circled up
It’s going down 'round these pick up trucks
Yeah, it's cold cans and Dixie cups
Just out here doin’ what we've always done

Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

Long live the Walmart, parking lot
Turning to thе midnight party spot
Long live hard work, when it pays off
And living it up on your days off

Long live all thе small towners, sunup to sundowners

Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

Long live them glory days, on them back forty days
All them pass it 'round, pass it down story days

And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya

Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby

And you'll learn

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"

Sometimes, all I think about is you

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Girl, you killing me, you tweakin' hard (Girl, you tweakin')
I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)
You must want another nigga to be alarmed (What you want see?)
We were 'posed to fight through the storm
You made a decision, chose the easy one
Say you following your heart, but girl you leaving one
Wanting me to take you back with open reaching arms (And I can't do that, mama)
I-I-I-I-I I'm
Lost for words, let it hurt

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

Fumez The Engineer"
Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet

La Noche de Anoche,Bad Bunny & Rosalia,"Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar, sé que sería tu debilidad

Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o

Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (Mmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (Yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón
Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (Bum)
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabe' que solo lo hago de leyenda (¡Wuh!)
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su Messiah
El Benito es un diablillo y es un ángel
Lo tengo juquea'o como si fuera tote
Baby, entre nosotro' nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice: ""Ella to' los récords bate""

Eso era dando, dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)

Mmm-jum
Mmm-jum
Mmm-jum"
Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"
Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view
A Hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A Hell of a view"
Beers And Sunshine,Darius Rucker,"Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the dock
Kick back in my flip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin' spinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine, oh

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

Oh, beers and sunshine
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah"

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"
Sand In My Boots,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots"

And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose

'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life

Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone

And I had told 'em I love 'em so much
To me, it felt like you can't do wrong

I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers, ""Don't know what a Patek is""

Asked them why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30 like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas being goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' 'round with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bagged up with fifty one-hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call the dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?

Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up

Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (Mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (Out)

Cover Me Up,Morgan Wallen,"A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good"

Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, ""Lord, help me, I've been lonely""
That's when you accept me, then you set me free

Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
There's one that won't never leave you cold
Or place nothing above you
That will love a heart that hurts
Don't hurt the heart that loves you
Sometimes they just want what they can't have, forbidden fruit
But the one that deserves your love will never pick and choose
There was once a hole in my heart, that hole was hurting
'Til I took a peek inside, lately I've been soul searchin'
When I use to cry, I turned to medication
Then I found me something real and forgot all the imitations
Just tell me that you'll never leave
And when there's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway, ah

Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
And I swear I would never leave you cold
There ain't no one above you
You were way too high to touch
I was high enough to pass out
When you was so alone, I was a stone's throw away
I remember those lips, I remember how they taste
I been staring at the wall, doing nothing all day
I remember everything, put the bottle to my face, Dom Pé
If you gave up on me now, I would seriously be so fucked up
I'm doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up
Never gave a fuck what they say 'bout us
Fuck all of you muh-fuckers slow me up
And fuck everything that ruined us
I'm three seconds away from pulling out my gun"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

Up,Cardi B,"Up, up, up (Ayy), up (Uh), up, look (This is fire)
Once upon a time, man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch who nigga wanna fuck on me

I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back and all you bitches fucked
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Huh)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)
I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train (Skrrt)

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter

When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone

What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?"
Heartbreak Anniversary,Giveon,"Ooh

Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
(Oh-ooh) No
(Ooh) No, no, no
(Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life? (My life)

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary

I pray these niggas understand how passionate the tale is
To get you under my pressure
Richer
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'

Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
""The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino""
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure"
Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"

Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Street Runner,Rod Wave,"(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'

Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin

Look, uh

Sorry I missed your call, I was on a jet
I been so zoned out, tryna figure out what's next
So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone (Yeah), wishing I could hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (Yeah)
I hope chasin' my dreams don't get in the way
I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay ya down but I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain
She tell me fuck you, I hate you, then I love you, can't blame you
She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you

Going higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)
Taking me higher (Taking me higher)
Higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Without You,The Kid LAROI,"You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like

And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Better Together,Luke Combs,"A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here"

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed

You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy

They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image"

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
Down to one
I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""
Down to one
Down to one"
Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)

My heart is breaking, my heart is—, my heart is aching
Hey, ayy, ayy

She's a runner, she's a track star

She can't take the pain, she can't get scarred

Girl, you killing me, you tweakin' hard (Girl, you tweakin')
I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)
You must want another nigga to be alarmed (What you want see?)
We were 'posed to fight through the storm
You made a decision, chose the easy one
Say you following your heart, but girl you leaving one
Wanting me to take you back with open reaching arms (And I can't do that, mama)

Lost for words, let it hurt

Hard times, wait for it and then she break for it (And then she break, yeah)
Love don't cost a thing, ashamed how much I paid for it (I'm ashamed)
Love don't cost a thing ashamed how much I gave for it
Heart broken into pieces put tape on it (Woah-woah)
Fragile made out of glass, close the drapes on it (Woah-woah)
Trust issues so deep playing safe on it (Woah-woah)
Will I ever love again or will I stay lonely?

Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? (Fuck up my life)

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"
Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view

We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge

Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"
La Noche de Anoche,Bad Bunny & Rosalia,"Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar, sé que sería tu debilidad

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no está' a mi la'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o

Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Yo encima de ti, tú encima de mí (Oh-oh)

Que yo me iría otra vez pa' Japón (Hey)
Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (Mmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (Yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón
Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (Bum)
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabe' que solo lo hago de leyenda (¡Wuh!)
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su Messiah
El Benito es un diablillo y es un ángel
Lo tengo juquea'o como si fuera tote
Baby, entre nosotro' nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice: ""Ella to' los récords bate""
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no está' a mi la'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o

Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)

Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes"
Quicksand,Morray,"Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands

I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up

Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Hearts breakin'

Lost,NF ,"Look
Self-awareness
Pride's a coat and yes, I like to wear it
Buttoned up, don't like to let no air in
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
I discovered, though, when I get holes in them and I let joy in, I'm in higher spirits
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Just repeatin' lyrics, I can barely bear it when I'm lost
Road is narrow, I'm lookin' down it like a gun's barrel
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is that we're lost
Yeah, but what does it matter?
I get so combative, inside of me's a personal canvas
The paint can be splattered, get messy when I start to get rattled
The heart of a savage, I'm quiet when I lurk in the shadows
But somethin' don't add up, I don't wanna be overdramatic
But look at the data, it's obvious that humans are fragile
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
We need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
Keep my wits, been off the grid but now I'm back in the saddle
My intent is not to rent, I like to own what I value
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I like to row against the current, that's the way that I travel
Opposite of what the grain does, got the brain of a rebel
Take initiative, I'm diligent on every level
I never could settle, I like to keep my foot on the pedal, yeah
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
And put the reins on 'em, show 'em I'm the one that's the boss
And pull 'em back when they get out of hand, I'm breakin' they jaws
I'm takin' the flaws, that told me I could never evolve
Then pull a Bane on 'em, ask 'em, ""Oh, you think you're in charge?""
You oughta know better, ain't no way around it, I'm flawed
The traits that I want, they say I can't afford what it cost
But I, manifested this
Failing's how you grow and learn your lessons, kids
Take the worst and try to make the best of it
'Cause when you fail, just know that it's a test and if
You can learn to pick yourself back up again
And train your brain to not be such a pessimist
It's okay to make mistakes, just don't forget that
There's a high road but I skip the exit when I'm lost (Lost)

Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
When I'm lost, lost

Wow, these burdens are heavy
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be found
Am I a big ol' parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where I'm spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
Look, I'm tryna wash away my sins
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
So when it come to anybody, there's no trust for no one
Man, so what? My whole plan's to go nuts
My shoulders ready for more shrugs, I'm gon' judge
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (Hol' up)
My sanity's gone, I'd rather be torn
From this planet they planted me on, yes, that's a reward
I'm actually bored with having a sore heart
It's torn apart from a family that I don't have anymore (Man, hol' up)
I was livin' so oblivious
With millions, it really was a pity, huh? (A pity, huh?)
It's kinda funny what a penny does
Mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Life's got me by the neck, with a blade against it (What?)
Guess I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (What?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (What?)
So I'ma act out like a ragin' misfit (What?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (Yeah)
You wanna hate me? Good, great, terrific (Good)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wish list 'cause I
Yeah, manifested this
Do not treat me like some adolescent kid
I am prayin' to the Lord with the Book of James
Hopin' He gon' add my testament
This dark cloud, that's my residence
Demons knockin', I don't have to let 'em in
I done made mistakes, day to day
You probably can't relate
I just ain't the same when I'm lost (Lost)

Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm, when I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
When I'm lost, lost"
Sand In My Boots,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots"
Beers And Sunshine,Darius Rucker,"Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the dock
Kick back in my flip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin' spinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine, oh

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

Oh, beers and sunshine
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah"
Follow You,Imagine Dragons,"You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepеst low
I'll always be around wherevеr life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here coming through)

I will follow you way down wherever you may go (I'll follow you)
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you (I'll follow you)
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you"

Nobody,Dylan Scott,"Baby, I see them boys
They always lookin' at you
But I ain’t causin' a scene
'Cause girl, I’m the one that's with you
They can shoot you a wink, they can buy you a drink
Try to steal your attention
They can talk a big talk, they can walk a big walk
But I know you ain't going home with 'em

Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

I know how you like your coffee
And how hot you like your bath
I know what makes you angry
And what makes you laugh
I know the taste of your lips, every inch of your skin
The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine
Saying baby, take me home
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

I’m gonna love you, love you
The only way that I know
I’m gonna love you, love you
Like there's no tomorrow
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do (Like I do)
I’ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I"
Glad You Exist,Dan + Shay,"Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause еvery high and every low lеd to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go, don't you ever go changing
Never let me go, never let me go, never let me go, baby
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go, don't you ever go changing
Never let me go, never ever let me go, never let me go, baby

There's a couple billion people in the world (In the world, yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Take a moment just to take it in (Just to take it in, yeah-yeah-yeah)
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh"
Like I Want You,Giveon,"Sometimes I wish you knew
But I disguise the truth
I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us, mm-mm-mm
Does your mind play this game too?
Think 'bout me and you
I guess I'll just pretend until it all makes sense, hm-mm-hm, hmm-hmm

See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene
See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
But I can't make a scene, but I can't make it seem

Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Even if it's true

I guess it's overdue
Tell me your point of view
Tell me, am I to blame?
You're so good with change, hm-hm-mm
A table set for two
You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through
Try to stay patient but gotta face the truth, mm-mm-mm
Oh, woah-woah
See you face to face (See you face to face), I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (Thinking 'bout the days)
But I can't make a scene (No, I can't make a scene), but I can't make a scene (No, no, no, no, oh)
See you face to face (See you face), I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (Oh-oh)
But I can't make a scene (No, no-no, no-no), but I can't make it seem

Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh (Even if it's true)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (You, babe)
Even if it's true

There's no reason to believe I'll save us now
But if you really love me, say it now
Why is it so hard to figure out?
I need you every day, believe me when I say it

Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Even if it's true"

Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
A caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh)
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh"

Ya no te quiero ver llorando, ese no vuelve hacerte daño
Bebecita, te lo garantizo (¡Wuh!)
Es que lo de ella y lo mío e' un romance en secreto
Calla'o, bien en discreto, la beso y la aprieto (Oh)
Me la llevo por el mundo y gasto el ticket completo
(Por ella reviento a cualquier sujeto)
A ella le gusta lo malo, lo bueno, lo caro
Titerona, no se asusta si escucha un disparo
El cuerpo e' hermoso, los ojos son claro'
Era mi reina, ahora e' mi diosa, a ella ni la comparo

Qué pereza
Verla triste con tanta belleza
Quien dañó un corazón con mucha pureza
No sabe tratar con delicadeza (-deza)
Princesa, a él no le interesa
Si yo soy el que te toca y te besa
Cuando la vi yo dije: ""Quiero con esa""
Desde esa vez no sales de mi cabeza
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo? Dígame por qué llora (Baby, ¿por qué llora?, ey)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora (Pa' meterle ahora, jaja)

Fucked you, now he mad he ain't know (Gang)
This ain't OG, this just smoke and this shit Thrax for real (This that Thrax for real)
This that shit that have you chokin' and it got Tooka killed (It got Tooka killed, uh)
Niggas chasin' clout and claimin' bodies they ain't do for real (Huh? What? Who? Huh? Damn, damn)
And my bitch got ass shots, but I promise that this strap is real (Ayy, grrah, grrah, grrah)
This ain't OG, this just smoke and this shit Thrax for real (This that Thrax for real)
This that shit that have you chokin' and it got Tooka killed (Huh? What? It got Tooka killed)
Niggas chasin' clout and claimin' bodies they ain't do for real (Damn, huh?)

Finesse Out The Gang Way,Lil Durk ,"(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

I came from nothin', I had to go get it
I had to finesse out the gang way (Gang way)
I done did everything for the niggas that I love
Who stuck in the chain gang (Chain gang)
Shit be so weird, I'm steady watchin' all the niggas who yellin' out, ""Gang, gang"" (Gang, gang)
Shit be so different, I'm watchin' them niggas who bitches but yellin' out, ""Bang, bang"" (Bang, bang)
Roll up a blunt of that Pluto
Used to be deep, now I'm riding 'round uno
I know some niggas who hustlin' but quit
'Cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers
But now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much
To me, it felt like you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out the side of my granny crib
I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers, ""Don't know what a Patek is""
Now it's two-tone

The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
Asked them why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30 like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas being goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' 'round with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bagged up with fifty one-hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call the dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (Got me in my feelings)
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?

Man, I've been trappin' since 2007
My mama was strugglin', I had to help her
From juvenile to penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy I can say I got it together
Fifty-three percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a gangsta, I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like businessmen
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bows to my brother 'nem
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama, ""We need a bigger house""
I'm too real for this shit, I done figured out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (Mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (Out)
I ran it up to a low from an ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought
I ran it up in this motherfucker
Three hunnid shots, that's enough in this motherfucker
Only The Family, it's us in this motherfucker, gang shit
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?
The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

Undivided,Tim McGraw & Tyler Hubbard,"You see, Billy got picked on at school
For things he couldn't change
He tried his best to play it cool
But in the seventh grade
You either fit right in or you don't fit
That's just the cold hard truth
I wish that I'd have been the friend
That Billy never knew

I think it's time to come together
You and I can make a change
Maybe we can make a difference
Make the world a better place
Look around and love somebody
We've been hateful long enough
Let the Good Lord reunite us
'Til this country that we love's
Undivided (Yup)

You either go to church or you're gonna go to Hell
Get a job and work or you're gonna go to jail
I just kinda wish we didn't think like that
Why's it gotta be all white or all black?
And when we gon' learn to try on someone's shoes sometimes? (That's right)
And when we gon' start to see from someone else's eyes?

Once upon a time, man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch who nigga wanna fuck on me

I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight

Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
Save Your Tears,The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,"Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)

Blinding Lights,The Weeknd,"Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch"
Levitating,Dua Lipa ,"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name

These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'
Every time I start to close the door, you knock and I let you in
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin

Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone (Yeah), wishing I could hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (Yeah)
I hope chasin' my dreams don't get in the way
I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay ya down but I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain
She tell me fuck you, I hate you, then I love you, can't blame you
She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you
I just hope we don't end how they do
Crash and burn on The Shade Room

Street runner, gotta stop running sometimes (Yeah)
I'm in your city tonight (Yeah)
And these lights (These lights), make me feel so inspired (Yeah)
Going higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)
Taking me higher (Taking me higher)
Higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher"

You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby

What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed

Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"
Whoopty,CJ,Freestyle Off My CJ Whoopty
Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past

Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)

Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover

Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Better Together,Luke Combs,"A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"
We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"

I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' a line today

Fuck it, I'm crossin' a line today

To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
""The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino""
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure"

You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy

How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

There were times I couldn't even breathe (Mmm)

I tried to scare you, scare you away
Showed you the door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind

Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged
Never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself

Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)
But you're the one I call for security (Oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
Through everything, you been my rock

Oh, I know God was listening

Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground

If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?

Sunrise but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view

We ain't for everybody

I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life"
Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"
2 Much,Justin Bieber,"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be

I say ""I love you"" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done

I say ""I love you"" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much"

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands

Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like

Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice

'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes"
Loved By You,Justin Bieber ,"I bought a castle in France and it's the same one
I built in the sand for you, when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you

I need to be loved by you
I need to bе loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to bе loved by you

I remember when we started datin'
The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is a everyday ting, baby
You and me in different places
Textin' and messagin' and talkin' crazy
When I'm with you, I feel like it's a daydream
That's how I know that you would always be my baby
(All I do) Is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you

I walk a thousand miles
I've opened every door
It's not enough
It's still your love I'm always looking for
It's just the way I'm wired
Whether I'm wrong or right
I've only got one thing on my mind

I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you (You)
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you"

Who gon' defend you likе an army (Gon' defend you like an army)

Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)

Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star
It's the way you light up every room just bein' who you are
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you, oh woah)
Look, before I met you, I never believed in magic
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know (Yeah, yeah) that you know (Yeah, yeah)
What we got, it don't come easy

It's okay, it's okay

Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon

Sand In My Boots,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots"

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone

I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you

If she ride for me (Ride), she don't need a key
If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot, said, ""Mm-mm, don't go there""
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air

And my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
Let's celebrate 'cause we the baddest in the club

You Broke Me First.,Tate McRae,"You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Y si tú me tira', vamo' a nadar en lo hondo (Nadar en lo hondo)
Si es por mí te lo pongo
De septiembre hasta agosto
Y a mí sin cojone' lo que digan tu' amiga'
Ya yo me enteré, se nota cuando me ve'
Ahí donde no ha' llega'o sabe' que yo te llevaré
Y dime qué quiere' beber, e' que tú ere' mi bebé
¿Y de nosotro' quién va a hablar? Si no nos dejamo' ver

Y a vece' e' Dolce, a vece' Bulgari
Cuando te lo quito despué' de lo partie'
La' copa' de vino, las libra' de mari
Tú estás bien suelta, yo de safari
Tú mueve' el culo fenomenal
Pa' yo devorarte como animal
Si no te ha' venío', yo te vo'a esperar
En mi cama y lo vo'a celebrar"
Heartbreak Anniversary,Giveon,"Ooh

Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
(Oh-ooh) No
(Ooh) No, no, no
(Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life? (My life)

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?

Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons

Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing

He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past

Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past

Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind"
Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo
Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo"
What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"

It’s going down 'round these pick up trucks
Yeah, it's cold cans and Dixie cups

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine

I know shawty admire me but I had to ghost her
Must've happened right after the time, after I post her
I'm puttin' this worldwide splash on some local
She had my attention from the first time I approached her
I'm puttin' two-tone on her wrist and on her choker
She a hottie, she a baddie, she a smoker
I've been contemplating ‘bout it, buyin' a roaster
Tryna get to know her
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Taylor Swift ,"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me"
Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)

You'll always be my baby

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"
SoulFly,Rod Wave,"(Pipe that shit up TnT)
So did you get it?
Yeah, I got it
Okay, I'm just checking
You alright?
(Tahj Money)
I don't feel good
Alright, call me when you get home
(Shaad Krounds)

Conversatin' with mama, she say I'm in too deep
Until my niggas rich and free, it's hard to get me some sleep
It's hard to get me some peace with all the shit that I be battlin'
So many ups and downs, sometimes I feel like I can't balance it
It be challenging, so many challenges (Yeah)
Oh father, it's safe to say times harder (This shit get harder)
My pops say, ""Son, be smarter, you a artist and a father""
My unc' say, ""Now, be smarter, you a target and rеgardless
You a leader to thеm people and them young niggas is watchin'
Them young niggas believe in you, don't let 'em down, be cautious""
And I got skills in other things but rich off rappin' pain
So much that came with all this fame, but I remain the same
Hope you don't think 'cause I got change, that's what made me change
It's just this life got so strange, I had to switch lanes
Niggas pulled up and I'll be outside
Laid in the cut like peroxide, yeah
I vowed to be frontline when shots fired
I was out of town that night when **** died, yeah
Standin' in church, blurry-eyed that I had to confess (Yeah)
I seen my nigga laid to rest in his Sunday best
Polo on his head and chest, now that's casket fresh
Wish we would've seen eye to eye before you left
And where I'm from, it's an eye for an eye, nothing else
Ain't no love, it ain't no help, every man for they self
Better watch your homies, keep your strap or get strapped to a shelf (Grrah)
Ain't no complaining, when it's raining, play the hand you dealt
Ain't got no opps, just some niggas who mad that I made it (Yeah)
And since you niggas mad I made it, pick a casket, baby (Grrah)
On the net exaggeratin', ain't even half as gangster
It's funny and it's fascinatin' how even family hatin'
Wanna hit the show but you ain't show up to my graduation (Yeah, yeah)
I can't take y'all to the top, I ain't no elevator
Think of my cousin Deyjah
Was way in 2013 when she left, I was 15 when she left
They say it won't be long, all I want
Is when the horn blows and when they all cry
I pray my soul flies, pray my soul flies
Pray my soul flies (Turn into the fuckin' birds)
They say it won't be long, all I want
Is when the horn blows and when they all cry
I pray my soul flies, pray my soul flies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pray my soul flies, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare the cabin for takeoff
Make sure your seatbacks are secured in the upright and locked position (Pray my soul flies)
Your tray tables put away and all carry on items are securely stowed (I pray my soul flies)
We will be moving through the cabin for a final safety check
And ask that you please review the safety regulation card located in the seat pocket in front of you
Now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight"

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Gone Till November,Rod Wave,"(Drum Dummie)
(KimJ with the heat)

On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone again
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go in and mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing, heart keep breaking

Uh, no matter what I do, can't keep nobody happy
Can't keep these haters off me, can't get along with my daddy
I hope when they get older that my kids can understand me
All I ever wanted with they mama was a family
'Cause all I ever felt growing up was abandoned
Pops went up the river, left a nigga out hеre stranded
But as I grew wisеr, I could finally understand it
It seems since a teen I been on my own planet
Lord knows I love my mama but I hate she think I'm crazy
Then got out here on my own, got in this world and made it
All the shit that we been through, you would think that I hate ya
Still put on my super suit, came back to you and saved us
I was lost as a teen, can't believe that I made it out
Can't believe I got everything that I prayed about
And I knew for a minute what's too good to be true
All the shit I took you through, girl, I apologize to you
On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone (Yeah, again)
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go in and mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing (Yeah, yeah), heart keep breaking (Keep breaking)
On the road, halfway home
Sorry my friend, I don't wanna be alone
So I, I'll be gone 'til November, go in and mark your calendar
Phone keep ringing, heart keep breaking"
Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Don't Forget,Rod Wave,"It just seem like you real angry
You know why I'm mad? Let me tell you why I'm mad
I'm mad because, everybody on these records lyin'
Everybody lyin', everybody's this big D-boy (Pipe that shit up TnT)
Everybody be hardcore gangster, everybody gon' do this to each other when they see each other
And the truth be told, we too blessed and be having too much money in this rap game to be going to war with each other

Hold up, I got a lil' more in me 'fore you say I'm finished
Before you judge me, take a minute, go to the beginning
When we was grinding, I was minding my own fucking business
Now all these niggas think it's straight to go state they opinion
Kicked out the house, bitch, I was grinding, savin' every penny
Kicked out the house, I had my own house that same December
Ain't do no hatin', I was waiting patiently to get it
Used to let my cousin use the kitchen, cook a half a chicken
That's a half a block, he cut a thousand rocks in thirty minutes
Now that I'm straight it's like they hate to see a nigga winnin'
I just did XXL, me and my nigga Jigga
Didn't want to do it, but I did it, had to rep the city
Go ask the city who the best that ever fuckin' did it
And when you ask 'em, try to ask 'em for to be realistic
Now that I'm up, they try they hardest just to break a nigga
Say what you want, but on my soul, I ain't changing, nigga
Can't shake the hood 'cause Hollywood nothin' like where I'm from
Still love the hood, but they hate it when that cheddar come
""Rod crashed the 'Vette"" but he came back in a better one
""Rod fixed the 'Vette,"" nah dawg, this shit a second one
Nah dawg, this shit a second one
Naw dawg, this shit was next to come
And between me and you, I never thought that I could take it this far
I still be thanking God that I made it this far
And don't you ever get it twisted
Youngin' come straight from out the trenches

We don't get nothing out of 'em no more, man
We don't get no social commentary
We ain't get no kinda knowledge out these records
Everybody just talking 'bout how many chains they got on, and how much dope they sold
But the truth of the matter is this, I don't believe you
'Cause I know you do not, I know you didn't sell no dope

And don't you ever get it twisted

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)

Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof

'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

How The Game Go,Rod Wave,"(Damn, Ryder)

Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?

Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me

Clouds,NF,"(ورس 1)
کم کم کارام بهتر میشن
اولاش رقت انگیز بود، چیزی راجبش نمیگم
صدای تشویق به گوش میرسه
عزممو جذب کردم
میکس تیپ کاره من نیست، و ساختش خسته کنندس
ساختن اهنگ طولانی، سخت و پر استرسه
که تصمیم گرفتم با خایه بشم
نتیجشو داری میبینی، حالشو ببرید
مثل همیشه، رپر همیشگی اینجاست، پس اخماتو باز کن
بدنیا اومدنم موثر بود، جاه طلبم، یکم بدجنس، آره خودمم
غیر هنری، غیر واقعی، شوونیسم(برتری دادن)، من اینا نیستم
پیش میرم، پُربار، با متن های مرموز، سریع، سرکش،
سلطان شرارت، آرتیست تک، هر کسی نمیفهمه،
متعهد میمونم، مستحکم، آره
اهل تقلید نیستم، اگر خوشت نمیاد، چون گوشت تلخی. استثنا قائل نشدن، مورد علاقمه
درست شدن معماها برام، مساوی با به تصویر کشوندن بی تمدنیم، با ایجاد کمی نا امنی، آره درسته
ساده و واضح، شکننده نیستم، شکست ناپذیر، حواست هست؟
من بروس ویلیس تو لاشه قطارم(اشاره به فیلم شکست ناپذیر در سال 2000) ،انگار که بتونم ماشین رو با جت تعویض کنم، انگار رییسی ام که ناراحته چون ازش حقوق کمتری خواستن، انگار که با گردن شکسته بخوام کله پا وایسم، انگار که بگم اولین قدم زدن های بچتو دیدم، انگار که بگم بیل گیتس نمیتونه اجارشو بده چون ورشکسته هستش، چی دارم میگم؟ شدنی نیستن، غیر قابل تصورن
هم منطقی هستم و هم میتونم لجباز باشم، اگه مجبور بشم همه چی رو میگام، دوست ندارم از راه ساده بترکونم و موفق شم، اون چیزی که فکر میکنی نشدنیه،
من صد بار انجامش دادم، صد بار،
ممکنه مرزها رو جابه جا کنم، ایده ها نجومیه، بعضی اوقات طنزشم میکنم، آره کارام غیر قابل مقایسه هست،
هر چقدر گوش کنیش خسته نمیشی،
انتخاب بیت شاهکاره، غیرممکنه بتونی جلومو بگیری،
ساعت رولکس گرون قیمت دستم نمیکنم، با آدمای متقلب نمیپرم، جایزه ای نداشتم، نمیدونم چرا خدا منو انتخاب کرد،
یک چیزی تو لیوانم هست که کدئین نیستش،
بهم گفتن استایلتو عوض کن، حالا الان منو رفیقشون میدونن، آروم بیاین پشتم
با کی شوخی میکنی؟ چطور بهم شک داری؟
من همیشه تحویلش دادم(اهنگامو به موقع بیرون میدم)، نمیتونی به مهارت من تو رپ کردن برسی(بازی با کلمات میکنه درباره دندون عقل و دانش که یک کلمه هستن)،
اولش تو فکرم بود که صبر کنم، اما چی بگم؟ باید یک سر بهتون میزدم، رو به راهین؟
سال گهی داشتین؟(بخاطر کرونا)، اره میفهمم
گوش به زنگن تا آهنگم بیاد، کل صنعتو بلرزونم و شوکشون کنم،
این اهنگ مثل شهاب سنگ بیرون میادش، با برخوردش به زمین ازت میپرسه آماده ای یا نه؟
کسی مثل من نیست، بهترینم، جلوم کسی نیست، بهتره بهم احترام بزاری، وگرنه جسدتو لگدمال میکنم،
باشه اعتراف میکنم که یکم اغراق آمیز بود،
هر بار که پامو رو زمین میزارم مثل بعضیا قیافه ماتم زده نمیگیرم، بعضی اوقات منو با یک اوشکول تپه دیگه اشتباه میگیرن،
زمین به رعشه افتاد، بیا از بحث خارج نشیم،
حتی اهنگ های کمتر دیده شده ام هم حواسشونو به خودشون پرت میکنه که چطور از پسش بر اومدم؟،
بعضیا میگن من تاثیرگذاری بالایی دارم، من در این باره نمیدونم، اما من بهترین کاریو که میتونستم انجام دادم

(Jai Beats on the track, boy)
Shh, shh
Yeah, look, look, look, uh

I tried to motivate the people but I made 'em angry
I tried to show 'em it was all love, that made 'em hate me
They criticize me and talk bad 'bout me on the daily
I get the money and stay out the way, they think I'm crazy
Maybe if I weren't built for this, I'd let it phase me
Can't bend or fold, my folks dependin' on for me to make it
I'm ATR for life, the leadеr of the fucking navy
This HitHouse entеrtainment, baby, we all drive Mercedes
It's crazy, we came a long way to get to this
I opened up about my pain, let the world in
I know exactly how it feels to come out the bottom
How the hell you hate on somebody with so much in common?
Stay to myself and get these dollas
Take care grandma, take care mama
Get the bread and feed my partners
Never hear my name in drama
I'm focused on these commas
Fuck a bitch, I love my kids, they grandmama, and they mama
Don't care about no followers
I made my first million way before I made it big
I made my second million way before I made my kids
My third and fourth million, I made 'em the same night
My fifth million, made 'em when they platinumed ""Heart on Ice""
On the phone with the lawyer talkin' 'bout my next five (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look, if I could make ten, then I can make a hunnid
Then I can make a billion, we turned nothing into something, yeah
The youngest out my city but the dumbest out my city (Out my city)
Youngin' ran up some millies, ain't have to dickride to get it
And I still fuck with Gates but sometimes I'm in my feelings
I know that it's been a minute, I hope your heart finish healing
It was a long, long, dark road

Look how he put the odds to rest, look how he overcame
Look how he showed you he the best still

Montero (Call Me By Your Name),Lil Nas X,"I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)

Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo
Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo"
On Me,Lil Baby,"(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me"

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"
Without You,The Kid LAROI,"You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally

Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons

Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy

It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

Let's end this like we should and say we're good

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine

Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Won't be no hostage, I'm leavin' (Yeah)

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands

And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'

No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'

I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'

No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby

Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wilding, I’m on a thousand

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority

Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City

All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey

I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place

I just jumped off the lear like a savage
I done turned another one of 'em up knowing I'm careless
I can't have love for these hoes who crabbin'
Saint Laurent my attire, made it a habit
I got more than one, I done made it a habit
And I wanna know if you gon' be there when I need you (Oh, oh)

You fuckin' with a gangsta this timе
Less than fifty in her Birkin then shе ain't one of mine (No)
Adding brightness to your glow, they see the difference in your shine
Codependent, long as you got me you never in a bind, Nate
A nigga go ape shit 'bout you, primate
A drinker not a smoker but for me you hit that pound cake
They say I started somethin' when I had gave you the Lamb'
And other shit they can't see 'cause everything ain't for the 'Gram (Shh)
I put it down
I don't know who need to hear this, another nigga could never
Spoilin' her too easy, make it harder for the next one
I'd rather put her on game than run it on her (Run it on her)
If you can put up with me, you a fuckin' soldier (Gangsta)
You one of them one (My whole life has changed, the one)

Get my attention, inspire me  in a see through
I need to be careful 'bout energy I feed you
I did it to her on a jet, it felt so lethal
I feed you racks, feed you racks, like seafood
I know shawty admire me but I had to ghost her
Must've happened right after the time, after I post her
I'm puttin' this worldwide splash on some local
She had my attention from the first time I approached her
I'm puttin' two-tone on her wrist and on her choker
She a hottie, she a baddie, she a smoker
I've been contemplating ‘bout it, buyin' a roaster
Tryna get to know her
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to trust you

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time

I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day

Forgets he ever even heard my name

So far above feeling anything

It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look
I’m changin' up your salary 'cause I'm gettin' to know you
Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah
Bando to bando, traphouse, yeah
Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah
Can't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah
Why would I front like it ain't my fault?
Drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, ""Jesus Christ,"" but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah

Hit it all night, we was drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)
Drinkin' and smokin'

I done went from GG to BB to LV
I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini
I text her ""So proud of you"" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, ""Girl, I creamed""
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turn me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, ""Jesus Christ,"" but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah

I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini

Follow You,Imagine Dragons,"You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepеst low
I'll always be around wherevеr life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here coming through)

I will follow you way down wherever you may go (I'll follow you)
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you (I'll follow you)

La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

Buss It,Erica Banks,"Part 1

They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer
Sin Squad, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Plugged In, free all the getbacks
Serious splashers, soul snatchers
Grrr, bow
Us never them
You ain't never did it

Typers typing, gangdem riding
I just left the 2's, now I'm hearing sirens
I'm three deep on the next block, we're two poles up, this can never be silent
Shawty's all at mine and excited, I make her slurp it up and then ride it
She asked me to make a song about girls, I said ""Nah babes, I'm promoting the violence""
He's gassed, putting his bitch in Chanel
'Til gang pulled up and he got touched and we left him to drip with his girl
Show me a traphouse, I'll show you a stain
These cars get flipped when they creep on the L
Feds want me to rot up in jail
If I link GP, said I'm breaching my bail
Thought he was gang until he folded
'Course we slimed him out like one snail
I still link O for the pack of the opps
And everyone knows who it is from the smell
Run up on me, untuck it
Leave lungs punctured, or we just click it and bang
You go shooting range and you ain't got aim
If I press this button, hit you and your man
Pop them doors, tryna do it close range
Aim, buss it, Erica Banks
Said I don't smoke no more, let me roll one, fuck it
Now I'm just high as Lampz
Still too much M to the dome
Shout ""What's his name? He's my favorite strand""
Serious stepper, outstanding member
I'll find it offensive if you ask if I lack
Lampz got one in the head
Wig all open
K1 dead on the scene, I don't know how the 2's is coping
My lil' bro love drills, he's upcoming like Phil Foden
Sin Squad known for the slappin'
Sin Squad known for the pokin'
Free SlapIt, the judge gave him thirty
He held that and he showed no emotion
I'm with the gang, we just got down my man
The fans like ""When's the music loading?""
Where's Lampost? I found him
Gimme a lighter, let me smoke him
That shit got me choking
Sin Squad ain't the ones to be provokin'
Ching man down with my black blade in my right hand
Rip shirts, Hulk Hogan
KayyKayy, that's my bronem, on foenem
I love me a caramel golden, Beyonce
Or my darkskin ting Kelly Rowland
The gang just got down Drettz (Ching)
They left my man soaking
Don't start with your wrist before I rob man, no Holding (Let me get that)
She suck my dick, but when my man died she post him
Jigga with the double-barrel dotty
That's a dilemma like Kelly Rowland
(Gunner)
About ""Spin that coupe""
No wonder you're missing
Tell bro-bro ""Stop right there, let me jump out the car, get close and wig him""
I swear shh got lucky that day, if he buck me and Sav then he's definitely finished
That day was an hour glide, we done my man, it was less than a minute
Back my ying out get close and fish him, me and gang can rap bout countless drillings
With it, sick in the head, I'm twisted
Rise that mash in less than an instant
More time it's a window chinging, nowadays hop in the ride and bring it
He ain't got juice on his fucking borer, somebody tell my man to zip it
Headshot, you're pissed, my shooter's been taping strips
You can get corn on the mains like Ramz or drenched in the dark like Swift
All I hear is ""DipDat"" that and ""DipDat"" this, man Kelvin weren't on piss
Bro said the ""Allow the fallen"", but them man chat like chicks
How's man questioning me 'bout how many times I've stepped on a paigon's strip? (LOL)
Drettz got drenched in front his yat, not gonna lie that bitch is thick
He was in the A driving an auto, tell me how did you crash your whip?
Skid, skrr, foot on the gas, on the next road we ducked down Swift (He's cutted)

Fumez The Engineer
Part 2
Ayo, TR, go brazy on these niggas man
Ayo, Ludo
They know alot of people ask us ""How is CDot funded? Where do you get your money from?"" The simple answer

Your friend got dropped, there’s no respawning (Aww, man)
If he’s a legend, my bro he’s a killer like Randy Orton
The gangdem got down him and him, they say that we gone too far
Bro hit Ramz with a dotz
Ramz tried save them shots, Ramz must have thought he was Van Der Sar
Mans on the lurk for spinnage
Bro if I have to, I’ll do it on my Jack like Grealish
This golden one she cute, she's talkin’ ‘bout love, had to put her on mute
Lets show the O how to spin this coupe
Farm Block thugs left their goons
Farm Block thugs left their goons

LR, spin this coupe
Lemme jump out, hate slappin' out cars
Remind man how I mind man, ran that day
He ran so fast, but didn't get far
I swear he's a Niner?
Should've got whooshed with the Star, instead he got Anglo Armed
Rambo, catch him, serious splashin'
SMB, SMB, no talk
We run Haringey map
I don't know how they chat on gang
'Bout ""YKTV"", you know the vibe
Two times gang got Clappz and Dappz
The animals need to fill this bine so in Farm tryna slay these pratts
How you gonna sing on the drills you did?
Trey Songz, but in the songs you rap

Lack on your block, that's critical drenchin'
Run man down tryna wet and cheff him
Why so fast? Still kweffed him
I hate when I pull up in flats, no cap
They all did the dash, man I had the intention
To send man to see their cousin, brother, OG, best friend or bredrin
My opps are stressin' in front of the church
Screaming out ""peace"" with the L to the reverend (That Dickhead)
Shawty won't hold this .40, why she wan' talk 'bout dates at the Weston
How many times did the foenem hop in the ride?
I said I'm in too like WSTRN
New watch, new necklace
System settings, please don't attend them
I love all my brothers, I put it on my mothers
You can't name a nigga that we ain't got
Me and 6ix used to lurk in the 2 so much, me and folks took it up as a day job
And if it's daytime trips I'm taking, merch on the L, by night it's taped off
GG stepped on the enemy turf
Three got burst, it was nuttin' like airsoft
And you ain't never took that risk
Opp block trip, two sticks and if I see pigs then bro's gotta floor it now
I don't even sip no drink but I still double cut, L21 pouring out (Pouring)
And there's still too much M to the dome, but when I link ****, he's loud
Sin him, blick him, walkway grinnin'
Spin him, Fivio Foreign style

(Gunner)
They like the Sinners tapped in the head
How many times have they tapped with intent?
If I tap on the spin then I tap it again (Tapping)
You know what, I might catch me an M
You know what, I might turn man off but I won't switch sides like Berbatov
Had to perform well to win that bunda, had me feeling like Jürgen Klopp
Just showed bro how to pull it on burst
LOL, I think the Woods' is cursed
I heard my man got hit a whoosh but I know the other ones got done up worse
You can’t get back on the getback and make the young G’s put blades in shirts (Ching Ching)
Lampz got slapped, he weren’t staying alert
Mello and Chop got put in a hearse
Sneak and creep like Assassin’s Creed
Me and S-a-v tryna S.a.D
Nowadays I gotta step on minors
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout PYTs
I’m shottin’ food and he’s talkin’ ‘bout refund
Ay rudeboy, bring that receipt
Bro chopped him up, he was begging him please
Fuck that we ain’t hearing no plea
When I was locked up didn’t get no bail
When I was locked up didn’t send no mail
Bro got the stick and put eight in his clip
We ain’t tellin’ no fibs, you heard my man fell
When Lampz went jail I fucked my man’s girl
I made shorty play with herself
Don’t blame her when it was his fault
It gets like that when you ain’t treatin’ em well (It's nuts)

Fumez The Engineer"
Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"
Rapstar,Polo G,"(Shout out my nigga Synco)

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished"

You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin

Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh

Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one

How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

You Broke Me First.,Tate McRae,"You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed

I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past

Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)

And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)

On Me,Lil Baby,"(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip

Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch

I disappear if you let me

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you

Heat waves been fakin' me out

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover

Made For You,Jake Owen,"Water towers are made for hearts and names

Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads

My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"
We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

Love Story (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy

The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher"
What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Forever & Always (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always""

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like

Faster than I'm gettin' over you

Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'

Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image"
Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fearless (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless

You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Taylor Swift ,"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me"
My Head And My Heart,Ava Max,"Baby, now and then

And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite if I can't decide, baby

You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love

Ayy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick

Hit the booth after I hang up with Maceió Hazis
I really fuck with dude, for real
Disruptive behavior eluded me
Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit
Caught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big
Tell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this
I got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic
My partner denied me, this bitch tried to bite me, he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em

Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg

Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it

My opportunity was knocking and I missed it

Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes

Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an ""I love you"" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)
That's never heard
That's never heard (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
An ""I love you""
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
That's never heard
Don't you shy away"
Fifteen (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

Won't be no hostage, I'm leavin' (Yeah)

The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you"
Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? (Fuck up my life)

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Dancing With The Devil,Demi Lovato,"Oh-woah

It's just a little red wine, I'll be fine
Not like I wanna do this every night
I've been good, don't I deserve it?
I think I earned it, feels like it's worth it
In my mind, mind

Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, yeah

It's just a little white line, I'll be fine
But soon, that little white line is a little glass pipe
Tinfoil remedy, almost got the best of me
I keep praying I don't reach the end of my lifetime, mm
Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil

Thought I knew my limit, yeah
I thought that I could quit it, yeah
I thought that I could walk away easily
But here I am, falling down on my knees
Praying for better days to come and wash this pain away
Could you please forgive me?
Lord, I'm sorry for dancing with the devil
Oh, yeah-yeah

Dancing with the devil, out of control (Yeah, yeah)
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know (Closer than you know)
Playing with the enemy (Oh), gambling with my soul (Woah, woah)
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil, mm
Yeah, yeah, mm"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone

And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished"

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same

I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big four shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sense
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks

I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan today, got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless

You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"
Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)

Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)

Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)

Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)

I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past

You Broke Me First.,Tate McRae,"You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first

You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

2:47 - 3:00

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Hearts breakin'
I'm a product of my
Oh, a product of my generation, oh, and I

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"

Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more

Back when country wasn't cool?

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría

Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando

Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man

Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

Wake up, got a million in diamonds that sit on the dresser, oh
Run up that check, now I'm flexin' my muscles, I feel like a wrestler
'Cause we come from nothin' to Rollies and plaques
Fake love, it was holdin' him back
Flashbacks while he pourin' the yak
Since a young nigga, he just wanted a sack
Used to daydream 'bout thumbin' through racks
Heat tuck, it get cold in the 'Raq
Tears fall while he loadin' the strap
Seen it all, he just wanna relax, uh-uh
I'm richer than I ever been
Put my heart before the bag, worst shit I ever did
Gave you a second chance and you left again, uh
'Member days I used to wonder, ""Would we ever win?""

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM

Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby

Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you

Quicksand,Morray,"Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone

My Head And My Heart,Ava Max,"Baby, now and then
I think about me now and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh woah

And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite if I can't decide, baby

Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

Momma's House,Dustin Lynch,"I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down

All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick

But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks

Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Taylor Swift,"Mr. ""Perfect face""
Mr. ""Here to stay""
Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
Everything was right
Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""
Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""

But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

Mr. ""Never told me why""
Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""
Mr. ""Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same
'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""
Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""
Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

You're perfectly fine
Mr. ""Look me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
You said you'd never go away"

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Run It Up,Lil Tjay ,"I just like the sound of it

Protect that Glock, oh, this Glock ain't no goalie, bro

Pop out, drippin' diamonds, ooh, Bentley butter cup
Youngest out my city, keep it smooth just to sum it up
No security, you see me but that Glock spit
Youngest nigga doin' it, that's why I pop shit

True to evеrything I did, there's really no flagin'
All my shit been goin' up, lil' nigga, no dodgin'

I been runnin' that money up, puttin' on (Go)
Ain't no end to this trend, it’s a marathon (Go)
Different breed, I might bust down a herringbone (Look)
Board a flight with them racks in my carry-on
Talkin' 'bout money, you know who to call (Bad)
It look like a riot, I fucked up the mall (Woah)
She diggin', have me and my whole circle, boss (Gang)
Gave me some top through my Ethika draws (Uh)

Them hitters ain't renters, the tag Arizona
Ain't get no diploma (No)
Shot dice for the J's, the freshest dude in the schoolhouse (Turn up for)
You ain't gangster, you went, took the smooth route (Been a ho)
Ran it up, now my pockets look too stout

Sold enough gas to go buy me a Texaco (Good petrol)
Now I'm on the charts, I'm runnin' up streams
My niggas still got what you need though (Go)
Built my name from the ground, I ain't have no help (No)
It's just me versus me, beefin' with myself (Bad)
It was time I woke 'em up, they overslept (Get up)
Run it up, run it up, still ain't out of breath (Go)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up

Give a fuck 'bout who love me, I run it up
What the fuck they gon' tell me? My money up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up"
Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"

Drankin N Smokin,Future & Lil Uzi Vert,"Saggin' out the malls, we do the most, oh
Had a ratchet in my coat, got a girl doin’ coke

We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look

Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah
Bando to bando, traphouse, yeah
Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah
Can't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah

Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed

Monsters,All Time Low ,"Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? (Fuck up my life)

4 Da Gang,42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch,"You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K"
Save Your Tears,The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,"Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I make you cry when I run away (Save)

Save your tears for another day (Ooh; oh)
Ooh, girl, I said (Okay)
Save (Save) your (Your) tears for another day (Oh yeah, yeah; oh)

Save your tears for another day (Oh)

Left her baggage for Rimowa

Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine

Rapstar,Polo G,"(Shout out my nigga Synco)

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
Blinding Lights,The Weeknd,"Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,"Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

And he's all mine

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon

Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

You Broke Me First.,Tate McRae,"You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

You can't compete when you can't compare (Period)
She ate the dick through my underwear (Uh)
Got up and got hеrself outta there
I see thеy put me on memes and things
Don't speak on my life without knowin' the real
Eight figures a year, what it cost me to live
Don't hold it, just say what you feel but
Watch your mouth 'fore I fly out your bitch (Where?)
To a place that she didn't know exist (Gone)

Ain't it man, sure know what to say
You ain't me so it's hard to relate (What?)
How much cash I fuck off every day? (Big Bagg)
Don't play with me, baby, go play with your pussy
You seen him in person these niggas be shooken
A huncho, it cost you a Quavo to book me
I'm worth it, the proof in the pudding
Surrounded by bitches (Four of 'em)
I'm lookin' like William but they ain't my girlfriends (Nah)
Bruh, I'ma spin on your block, back to back when I finish it, look like the world end (Dawg)
I ain't ask for it, they did it to me (What?)

Therefore I Am,Billie Eilish,"I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am (I am)
I'm not your friend (Friend)

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Hard For The Next,Moneybagg Yo & Future,"I just bought that chick a Patek
I ain't love her, but I just had to show her status
I just bought that bitch a Patek

Bought that bitch a Patek
I ain't love her, I just stepped up her status
Got her cookin' in the crib without no panties
I just jumped off the lear like a savage
I done turned another one of 'em up knowing I'm careless
I can't have love for these hoes who crabbin'
Saint Laurent my attire, made it a habit
I got more than one, I done made it a habit
And I wanna know if you gon' be there when I need you (Oh, oh)

You fuckin' with a gangsta this timе
Less than fifty in her Birkin then shе ain't one of mine (No)
Adding brightness to your glow, they see the difference in your shine
Codependent, long as you got me you never in a bind, Nate
A nigga go ape shit 'bout you, primate
A drinker not a smoker but for me you hit that pound cake
They say I started somethin' when I had gave you the Lamb'
And other shit they can't see 'cause everything ain't for the 'Gram (Shh)
I put it down
I don't know who need to hear this, another nigga could never
Spoilin' her too easy, make it harder for the next one
I'd rather put her on game than run it on her (Run it on her)
If you can put up with me, you a fuckin' soldier (Gangsta)
You one of them one (My whole life has changed, the one)
It's the Maybach drive itself for me, I better not touch the wheel in this car
You one of them one  (You were that special one, one)
This the life when you lovin' a star, no cap, I'm just

Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to trust you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to love you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to please you (Oh, yeah)

Get my attention, inspire me  in a see through
I need to be careful 'bout energy I feed you
I did it to her on a jet, it felt so lethal
I feed you racks, feed you racks, like seafood
I know shawty admire me but I had to ghost her
Must've happened right after the time, after I post her
I'm puttin' this worldwide splash on some local
She had my attention from the first time I approached her
I'm puttin' two-tone on her wrist and on her choker
She a hottie, she a baddie, she a smoker
I've been contemplating ‘bout it, buyin' a roaster
Tryna get to know her
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to trust you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to love you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to please you

Bought that bitch a Patek (My whole life has change)

If Pain Was A Person,Moneybagg Yo,"(Dee you poppin' your shit, nigga)
I been tryna figure out like
Why a motherfucker want you to be loyal to them?
And they ain't loyal to you, I don't, I don't really get that
Be tryna show love in private 'cause
They done told people they don't fuck with you in public and shit
That shit be crazy
I don't be understandin' that shit, niggas be feelin'
Slick way about bitches and
Come on man, if we ain't about no money, what we doin'? (Speak)

I done overplayed my part, they forgot about me, amnesia (It's cool though)
I done hit yours, you done hit mine, why you still mad? We even (I ain't on that)
The blogs put up anything (Shit made up), and the crazy part they believe 'em (For )
Nigga caught a charge and got locked up, only reason dude still breathin' (I swear)
I never make a hoe feel like I can't do no better than her (Who?)
Heard that she got a new nigga, my bag the biggest
She said he don't fuck how I fuck (Haha)
Bitch lied on God and her kids
Threw me off, damn, that fucked up my trust
I know a nigga'll cross you to win
Where you at with it? Yeah, I come from the bluff
Lil' bro don't go through there spinnin', can't do it myself (Why?)
'Cause my position
I'm peepin', niggas in slick competition
Really some bitches, sit down when they pissin'
They get some fame off me if I mention
But it's a shame on me if I did it
I know you obsessed with me and I get it
Stay in your lane and stay out my business (Over there)
Y'all running off with all these rumors and shit
Quick and shit, makin' assumptions
Next thing you know you judgin' a nigga, damn
What about the truth?
It's two sides to this shit
I've been that nigga
I've been lit, I've been the shit
Before I ever went public with a bitch
Y'all just catchin' on late
Speakin' on my personal life
My real life, talking 'bout how it's fake nigga
You ain't me, you ain't in my shoes
You ain't pay dues (Speak)

He ain't no gangsta, never did nothin' gangsta, that's what they said (That what they hollerin')
I done seen so many niggas end up dead 'cause they got misled (Facts)
Ain't got no time for no baby mouth ass nigga, tryna get spoon-fed (Nah)
All that he say she say, code red, numb to it, brain dead (Don't wanna hear it)
Without y'all, I wouldn't be shit
Hope the haters hear me loud and clear (I'm makin' sure)
Unc' told me, ""A scary man, a dead man, you can't live you life in fear""
So I'm takin' risks (Yeah)
You can't get a fair bond last time I checked
How them charges disappear? (Hol' up)
Lack of communication with my bitch (What?)
Got her actin' all insecure (Mane)
I come from the struggle like you did, nigga
Why the fuck you tryna down me? (Huh?)
If I gotta coach a nigga on how to be real, I don't need 'em around me (At all)
You can't fix your mouth to say I ain't fuck with you
At least one time, well, two times, nah, three times
Couldn't see the envy, I was too blind
See they probably thought I was runnin' out
Whole time I was holdin' back, shit an infinity clip
I'm what's goin' on, so I'm already knowin' my name gon' be in your mouth but
When you have them conversations
Make sure you mention he gettin' six figures for a show
Eleven whips paid for, house sittin' on four acres
Take care of his kids, treat all of 'em equally
Momma put up, she can wiggle her toes at night peacefully
Shit like that what I do it for, that's goals, nigga (Speak)

Hope for the best, prepare for the worse
However it come, just know that I'm ready (That's it)
You know a lie, don't give a fuck who tell it (Huh)
I know they mad but they never admit it (Who?)
It be your own people (Blood)
They gon' try to take advantage of you if you let 'em
They get a thrill off turnin' you down
But never gossip but how you help 'em
I heard it's niggas out hear wanna touch me
But I can't tell, I be where they at
Watch you draw the line, so stay over there
Don't come 'round the gang, don't throw up the set
You not what I rep
Why do some shit you gone regret? (Answer that)
Think smart with it, this shit chess (Ha)
Just 'cause y'all related, don't mean nothin'
Niggas Unc' ice about they check (I ain't Meech)
All that, ""You love me"", shit ain't genuine
And I felt the vibe when I walked in
Shit slick, hurt me thinkin' you solid then I saw you bend
Even after they true colors show, kept it real on my end
That wasn't my beef at first, I made it mine
'Cause me and bruh locked-in (For life and after)
When I say we la familia, we la familia, we locked in for life
Shit, loyalty over love
We gon' keep it real first
Like you not gon' see me fuckin' with my nigga opp
I don't give a fuck if I knew, his opp longer than him
Niggas'll hate you so much, they can know you'll opp a rat
And still hang with 'em
Don't that make them the same nigga?
Shit, let me know I need clarification
What part of the game is that?
See, I know what need to be done
Nigga need to start pullin', straight up checkin' these niggas
These niggas can't stand no pressure
You ain't gotta feel how I'm comin' where I'm comin' from
If pain was a person

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen

It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""

Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup

Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

Haters copy, I'm the image"

These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'
Every time I start to close the door, you knock and I let you in

Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin

So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone (Yeah), wishing I could hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (Yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired

Come Through,HER ,"OPENING SEQUENCE
INT. MICHAEL'S OFFICE
Jim and Michael are talking in his office
MICHAEL: All right Jim, your quarterlies look very good. How are things going at the library?
JIM: Oh, I told you. Couldn't close it, so—
MICHAEL: So you've come to the master for guidance? (imitating) Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
JIM: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
MICHAEL: All right, well, let me show you how it's done. (gets on phone) Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello! This is Michael Scott, I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you, manager-a-manager. (cut to the office and cut back) All right, done deal! Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. My mistake. (hangs up) That was a woman I was talking to. So. . .she had a very low voice. Probably a smoker. So. . .so that's the way it's done.
Cut to Michael, walking to the Dunder Mifflin logo
Michael: (to the camera) I've been in Dundler Mifflin for twelve years, the last four as regional manager. If you want to come through here, (opens the door to the main office) so we have the entire floor, so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see, ah this is our receptionist Pam. (goes to the receptionist) Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for' for ever, right Pam?
PAM: Well, I don't know!
MICHAEL: If you think she's cute now you should have seen her a couple of years ago! (makes faces)
PAM: What?
MICHAEL: Any messages?
PAM: Yeah, just a fax (hands the fax to Michael).
MICHAEL: Pam this is from corporate. How many times have I told you that there's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
PAM: You haven't told me!
MICHAEL: It's called the wastepaper basket. (throws the paper away, laughs) Look at that! Look at that face! (points to Pam)
Cut to Michael's office
MICHAEL: People say I'm the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before, you're hilarious, and you get the best out of us."" I think that pretty much sums it up (shows a mug, ""World's Best Boss"") I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Cut to Dwight, grabbing his headset, humming a song, Jim looks at the camera, helpless
Cut to Jim, talking to the camera
JIM: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply to them whether they can pay for it and... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Cut to Dwight and Jim, Michael walks to them
MICHAEL: Wazzaaaaaa?
JIM: Wazza. (to camera) He still loves that after seven years!
Michael and Dwight continue for a while
MICHAEL: (to Jim) What?
JIM: Nothing.
MICHAEL: Ok, all right. See you later.
JIM: All right, take care.
MICHAEL: Back to work.
Cut to Angela, pointing to Kevin that he has something on his face
Cut to Jan, entering
MICHAEL: (talking to Camera) Corporate really doesn't interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan, hello! I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton, right? Not to her face because, not because I'm scared of her, because I'm not, but yeah.
Cut to Jan, Michael and Pam, sitting in Michael's office
JAN: All right, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
MICHAEL: Me no get an agenda.
JAN: I'm sorry, what?
MICHAEL: I didn't get any agenda.
JAN: Oh I faxed one over to you this morning.
MICHAEL: Really? Cause I didn't... (to Pam) did we get a fax this morning?
PAM: Yeah, the one...
MICHAEL: Why isn't it in my hand? Because a company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem Pam, why didn't I get it?
PAM: You put it in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
MICHAEL: Yeah, that was a joke, that was actually my brother's, it was supposed to be with bills and doesn't work great with faxes.
JAN: Do you want to look at mine? (hands agenda to Michael)
MICHAEL: Yeah. Thank you.
JAN: Ok since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided that we can't justify Scranton branch and the Stanford branch. Michael don't panic--
MICHAEL: Oh ok. No, No no no no this is good, this is fine.
JAN: Michael listen, don't panic. We haven't made any decisions yet, I've spoken to Joshua in Stanford I've told him the same as you, and it's up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
MICHAEL: Ok no problem.
JAN: This does however mean that there is going to be downsizing.
MICHAEL: Me no wanna hear that Jan, because downsizing is a bitch, it is a real bitch, and I wouldn't wish that on Joshua's men, I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men, or women present company excluded sorry. Is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Cut to Dwight, tapping on Jim's right shoulder (while standing left from him.) Jim looks to the right and Dwight walks away laughing
Cut back
MICHAEL: Question: how long do we have to (phone rings) Oh, Todd Packer, terrific rep, do you mind if I take it?
JAN: No, go ahead.
MICHAEL: (picks up) Pac man!
PACKER: Hey, big queen!
MICHAEL: Oh, that's not appropriate.
PACKER: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
MICHAEL: I don't know what you mean.
PACKER: Look, I've been meaning to ask her one question. ""Does the carpet match the drapes?""
MICHAEL: (hangs up) Oh my god! That's so horrifying! Horrible Horrible person!
JAN: So do you think we can keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
MICHAEL: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.
Cut to the office, Ryan just arrived and Michael walks to him
PAM: This is Mister Scott.
MICHAEL: Guilty, Guilty as charged.
RYAN: Ryan Howard from the temp agency, set me down to start today
MICHAEL: Howard, like Moe Howard, Three Stooges? Right here, my vibe. (imitates Moe, high fives Ryan) Oh Pam, that's a guy thing Pam. I'm sort of a student in comedy. Watch this, here I go. (imitates Hitler) I'm Hitler, Adolf Hitler
Cut to Pam, talking to the Camera
PAM: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go. Because then I might It's just, I don't think it's many girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations, mostly water color, a few oil pencil. Jim thinks they're good.
Cut to Pam's desk
PAM: (on phone) Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.
Cut to Jim's desk
JIM: (on phone) Sure, Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, some just came up, two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
DWIGHT: What?
JIM: What are you doing?
DWIGHT: Just clearing my desk, I can't concentrate
JIM: It's not on your desk.
DWIGHT: It's overlapping. It's all coming over the edge. One word, two syllables : demarcation.
Cut to Jim's desk, he's put pencils between their desks as a fence. Dwight arrives
DWIGHT: You can't do that.
JIM: Why not?
DWIGHT: Safety violation, I could fall and pierce an organ.
JIM: (crosses fingers) We'll see (Dwight smashes all the pencils away with his phone) (to camera) This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Cut to Dwight, talking to the Camera
DWIGHT: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here even brought it up on my interview. I say, bring it on!
Cut to Pam's desk, Michael is standing there
PAM: You just still have messages for yesterday.
MICHAEL: Relax everything is under control Yeah, yeah, yeah oh that's important, right. Oh, this is so important, I should run to answer it.
Tries to leave as Six Million Dollar Man
PAM: What?
MICHAEL: Come on. Six million dollars man, Steve Austin, actually that would be a good salary for me don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan: I deserve a raise
PAM: Don't we all?
MICHAEL: I'm sorry?
PAM: There's nothing!
MICHAEL: If you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR, ok? Not today, ok? Pam just, be professional.
Cut to Michael, talking to the Camera
MICHAEL: I think I'm a role model here, I think I garner other people respect.
Cut to the office
MIICHAEL: Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP
Cut back to Michael
MICHAEL: People I respect, heros of mine, would be Bob Hope, Abraham Lincoln, definitely, Bono, and probably God be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world, in so many ways, that it's, it's really beyond words. It's really uncalculable.
Cut to the conference room
MICHAEL: Now, I know there's some rumors out there, and I just kind want to see'.
DWIGHT: I'm assistant regional manager, I should know first.
MICHAEL: Assistant to the regional manager.
DWIGHT: Ok. Can you just tell me please? Just a whisper in my ear.
MICHAEL: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everyone
DWIGHT: Please, ok. Do you want me to tell them?
MICHAEL: You don't know what it is!
DWIGHT: Can you tell them, with my permission?
MICHAEL: I don't need your...
DWIGHT: Permission granted. Go ahead
MICHAEL: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me, and Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stanford branch or this branch.
RYAN: (outside the conference room, on the phone) I heard they might be closing this branch down, That's just That's just the rumor going around this is my first day I don't really know.
OSCAR: Yeah, but Michael what if they downsize here?
MICHAEL: Not gonna happen
STANLEY: It could be out of your hands, Michael
MICHAEL: It won't be out of my hands, Stanley, ok? I promise you that.
STANLEY: Can you promise that?
DWIGHT: On his mother's grave.
MICHAEL: Well, eh no. Yeah it is a promise, and frankly I'm a little bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
STANLEY: It's just that we need to know
MICHAEL: Hold on a second, I think Pam wanted to say something, Pam? You had a look that you wanted to ask a question, just then?
PAM: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
MICHAEL: Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
DWIGHT: Pam, information is power.
STANLEY: So you can't say for sure whether it's gotta to be us or them.
MICHAEL: No no, no Stanley, no you did not see me in there with her. I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and interfere then they're gonna have to go through me, right? You know, you can go a mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillen.
Cut to Jim, talking to the Camera
JIM: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know, tonnage price of manila folders? Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mix berry.
Cut to Pam, eating yogurt at her desk
Cut to Pam, talking to the Camera
PAM: Jim said mix berries? Yeah he's on to me.

RYAN: Nice to meet you.
MICHAEL: Introduce yourself, be polite
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
MICHAEL: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So Dwight tell him about the kung fu, and the car and everything.
DWIGHT: Yeah, I got a 78-2-8 , I've bought her for 1200, fixed it up, now worth three grand.
MICHAEL: That is his profit!
DWIGHT: New engine, suspension I've got some photos (opens his drawer) Damn it!
MICHAEL: Ok, hold on, Judge is in session. What is the problem here?
DWIGHT: He put my stuff in jello again. (shows his stapler in Jello - Pam laughs) That's real professional, thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first time.
Cut to Dwight talking to the Camera
DWIGHT: It's ok here, but people some how is taking advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer sheriff's deputy on the week-ends, and you cannot screw around there. It's one of the rules.
MICHAEL: What is that?
DWIGHT: (tries to take it out) That's my stapler.
MICHAEL: No no no, do not take it out! You have to eat it out there, because there are starving people in the world, (laughs) and which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
DWIGHT: (points to Ryan) Ok, you know what? You can be a witness. (to Michael) Can you reprimand him please?
JIM: (eating Jello) How do you know it was me?
DWIGHT: It's always you. Are you gonna discipline him or not?
MICHAEL: Ooh discipline, kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys, the thing about practical jokes, is that you have to know when to start, as well as when to stop! And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop pulling Dwight's personal effects into jello.
JIM: Ok, Dwight I'm sorry because, I've always been your biggest Flam
MICHAEL: Nice, that's the way it is around here
RYAN: You should have put him in custard-y!
MICHAEL: Yes, new guy! He scores!
DWIGHT: Ok that's great, I guess, what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
MICHAEL: Pudding... I'm trying to think, another dessert to do.
Cut to Pam's desk, Jim is talking to her
JIM: Do you like to going out at the end of a week for a drink?
PAM: Yeah!
JIM: Oh, that's why we all going out, so we can have an end of the week drink!
PAM: Well then when are we going out?
JIM: I don't know, tonight, hopefully.
PAM: Ok, yeah.
Roy enters
ROY: Hey man!
PAM: Hey!
JIM: What's going on?
ROY: Hey baby!

Cut back
PAM: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
ROY: No, come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
PAM: Ok, I will be out in a few minutes so it's like twenty past five I've still to do my faxes.
Pam leaves
JIM: You know you should come with us, because you know we are going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office, I think it could be fun.
ROY: No, it sounds good but seriously we gotta get going
JIM: Yeah What's in the bag?
ROY: Just tell her I'll talk to her then.. (he leaves)
JIM: No definitely. All right dude, awesome, will do.
Cut to Jim, talking to the Camera
JIM: Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?
Cut to Michael's office, where he and Ryan sit down
MICHAEL: So, have you felt vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard, right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I am a friend first, and a boss second. Probably an entertainer third. (someone knocks) Just a second Right? Oh, hey do you like the Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Yeah Punk'd, and all that kind of stuff? You are going to be my accomplice, just go on with that ok? All right Just follow my lead, don't pimp me all right? Come in! (Pam enters) So corporate just said that I don't want to'
PAM: you got a fax
MICHAEL: Oh thank you (Pam wants to leave) Pam Pam? Can you come in here for a sec? Just have a seat, I was gonna call you in anyway, you know Ryan? As you know, there is going to be downsizing and you have made my life so much easier, in that I'm going to have to let you go first
PAM: What? Why?
MICHAEL: Why? Well, theft. And stealing.
PAM: Stealing? Um, what am I suppose to have stolen?
MICHAEL: Post-It notes.
PAM: Post-It notes? What are those worth, like 50 cents?
MICHAEL: 50 cents, yeah. You steal a thousand Post-It notes at 50 cents a piece, then you know you've made a profit margin. Resell of business Pam
PAM: Are you serious?
MICHAEL: Yeah.
PAM: I can't believe this, I mean, I have never even stolen as much as a paper clip and you're firing me.
MICHAEL: And the best thing about it is that we are not gonna have to give you any severance pay, because that is gross misconduct, and, just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. (Pam starts crying, Michael realises this) You've been X'd punk'd! Surprise it's a joke, we were joking around, you see? Ok, he was in on he was my accomplice (Ryan shakes his head) and there was cascand around booster thing, and we were showing the new guy around the kind of, to give him the field of place, so. God, you were, we totally got you.
PAM: You're a jerk
MICHAEL: Well, I don't know about that
Pam leaves
Cut to Michael, talking to the Camera
MICHAEL: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? No it's the people. The ""people"". My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17%, or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy, a first job in the country, barely spoke English, came to me and said ""Mr Scott, would you be the Godfather to my child?"" Wow, wow, wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
Cut to Jim's desk, Pam walks up to him
PAM: Hey
JIM: Hey how are you?
PAM: Good I thought you were going out for a drink with--
JIM: Oh no. How's your headache? Better, thanks.
PAM: Good Are you...

PAM: Yes
JIM: Yes do you wanna?
PAM: Yeah
JIM: Great, let me just Oh Roy
PAM: (leaving) Yeah, listen have a nice week-end!
JIM: Yeah definitely you too! Enjoy it
Jim gets something from underneath his desk
JIM: Come here... (walks into Michael's office, reveals Michael's ""The World's Best Boss"" mug in Jello.)

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back

I'm gonna love somebody like that

How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)

Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

And what makes you laugh

The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine
Saying baby, take me home

Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you

Falling in deep with the quicksand

Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof

Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take

They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi

Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney

Disruptive behavior eluded me
Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit

Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love

Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

Long Live,Florida Georgia Line,"Yeah, it's a Friday night, we circled up
It’s going down 'round these pick up trucks
Yeah, it's cold cans and Dixie cups
Just out here doin’ what we've always done

Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

Long live the Walmart, parking lot
Turning to thе midnight party spot
Long live hard work, when it pays off
And living it up on your days off

Long live all thе small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

Long live them glory days, on them back forty days
All them pass it 'round, pass it down story days

Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these"

Drankin N Smokin,Future & Lil Uzi Vert,"Saggin' out the malls, we do the most, oh
Had a ratchet in my coat, got a girl doin’ coke

We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look
I’m changin' up your salary 'cause I'm gettin' to know you
Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah
Bando to bando, traphouse, yeah
Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah
Can't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah
Why would I front like it ain't my fault?
Drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, ""Jesus Christ,"" but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah

Hit it all night, we was drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)
Drinkin' and smokin'

I done went from GG to BB to LV
I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini
I text her ""So proud of you"" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, ""Girl, I creamed""
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turn me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean

4 Da Gang,42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch,"You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K"
Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

I could go on and on
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times

Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I make you cry when I run away (Save)

Save your tears for another day (Ooh; oh)
Ooh, girl, I said (Okay)
Save (Save) your (Your) tears for another day (Oh yeah, yeah; oh)

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

Levitating,Dua Lipa ,"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company

I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
Can you kiss me more?

Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (Ah)
Drama make you feel (Ah)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh

Rapstar,Polo G,"(Shout out my nigga Synco)

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished"

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,"Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob

All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet

Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat

Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

You Broke Me First.,Tate McRae,"You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view

You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby

Go out like shootin' stars

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me

I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see

I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter

I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich

Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I–

Ayy, yeah
I got one, Laurie got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

(You know I got a lot to say)

What's Your Country Song,Thomas Rhett,"Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?"

Good Days,SZA,"Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind"

pov,Ariana Grande,"It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah"
Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
A caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh)
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

Wockesha,Moneybagg Yo,"Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"
Tombstone,Rod Wave,"Damn, this motherfucker too crazy, Saucii
Let that shit ride, Eighty8
When the shit over, it's over
I don't know what's after or, you know

I keep my gun in my drawers, ducking the sad news (Oh yeah)
My phone say seven missed calls, I know it's bad news
This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed (So hard)
I ain't did no shows but made some bread (Yeah)
I gotta keep the family fed (Yeah, yeah)
Look, just talked to pops about the feds
I ain't gon' lie, he had me scarеd, uh
I feel 'em coming, nigga (Yeah)
I'll keep on running, nigga (Yeah)
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga
My girl all in my ear screaming, ""Spend some time""
I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine (For sure)
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time

And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game
On my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally
I'll get to fly away, somewhere, someday
Fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name (Yeah)
Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)
By the river, they will carry me (Yeah)

Hold On,Justin Bieber,"You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on (Hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (Away, yeah)

Feels to be someone who loses their way

Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Nobody,Dylan Scott,"Baby, I see them boys
They always lookin' at you
But I ain’t causin' a scene

Try to steal your attention
They can talk a big talk, they can walk a big walk
But I know you ain't going home with 'em

Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

I know how you like your coffee
And how hot you like your bath
I know what makes you angry
And what makes you laugh
I know the taste of your lips, every inch of your skin
The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine
Saying baby, take me home
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you

Quicksand,Morray,"Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

I bet they want me shackled and locked in the chains
I guess that's just what happens with bad news

Still a youngin but feel like a OG
Can't forget all the shit that they told me
Tired of niggas thinkin' that they know me

You gon' turn me back into a savage
I done did shit you couldn't imagine
Leveled up and then bought me a mansion

I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, ""We'll be okay"", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off ramen and OJ
Shorty payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just trying to get me some dollars, a couple dollars
Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us

I ride by different spots, I get flashbacks
I can't get on your level, I'm past that
Watch me run that shit up, I can't go back to nothin', trying to get to the top of the world
My nigga went crazy, he walked in his condo and seen someone fuckin' his girl (Girl)
Fuck all that spinnin' blocks, that's that lil' boy shit, we catch him, we rockin' his world (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
I let everybody have they fun with me
Never had a woman say she done with me
I was workin', now I own the company
I keep money coming in constantly
My lil' brodie and them be having Runtz for cheap
Trying to get it, I've been on the run for weeks
I don't think none of you niggas could come for me
Both of my kids got it honestly
I'm the real deal
All the way, I don't half-step
Gotta do better than last year, that's my motto
Put a switch on the blick, fully auto
Put them thangs on the plane like I'm Ralo
Proud to say that I've finally changed up
Why the fuck they keep bringin' my name up? 'Cause I'm poppin'
I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, ""We'll be okay"", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off of ramen and OJ
I was payin' them bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just trying to get me some dollars, couple dollars
Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us

I'm so happy them days are behind me
I'm so happy the paper done found me
I done keep some good niggas around me
I got rid of them niggas who doubt me
Keepin' good energy and I'm prayed up
Tunnel vision, ain't nothing can phase us
Once you cross me, ain't nothing can save you
Pull that thing out, and fuck it, it's dangerous
Bitch, I'm dangerous"
Street Runner,Rod Wave,"(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'

Sorry I missed your call, I was on a jet
I been so zoned out, tryna figure out what's next
So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone (Yeah), wishing I could hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (Yeah)
I hope chasin' my dreams don't get in the way
I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay ya down but I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain
She tell me fuck you, I hate you, then I love you, can't blame you
She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you
I just hope we don't end how they do
Crash and burn on The Shade Room

Street runner, gotta stop running sometimes (Yeah)
I'm in your city tonight (Yeah)
And these lights (These lights), make me feel so inspired (Yeah)
Going higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)
Taking me higher (Taking me higher)
Higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher"

And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help

I'm puttin' this worldwide splash on some local
She had my attention from the first time I approached her
I'm puttin' two-tone on her wrist and on her choker
She a hottie, she a baddie, she a smoker
I've been contemplating ‘bout it, buyin' a roaster
Tryna get to know her

Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

Oh-oh
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Ooh
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again"

Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby

Somebody Like That,Tenille Arts,"I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, might take a while

But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like that"

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM

4 Da Gang,42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch,"You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K"

Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise

Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

I could go on and on
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey

Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me

Big Gangsta,Kevin Gates,"Put the soda on it, see what it do

A hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
She wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love
She say, ""I only get excited when the pack touch down""
Pray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

Hold up
Gimme that money, lil' nigga, you knowin' that I'ma do right with it
Private charter, they snortin' that tartar, I got 'em surrounded by white women
I got 'em looking like Paris Hilton
Each one of my teeth got a carat in it (Bling)
Ayy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick
Luca Brasi, I'ma speak for him

Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

These nigga showing me anger, they takin' it out on me
Hit the booth after I hang up with Maceió Hazis
I really fuck with dude, for real
Disruptive behavior eluded me
Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit
Caught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big
Tell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this
I got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic
My partner denied me, this bitch tried to bite me, he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em
(Well, damn)
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love

Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"

And Goon steady putting Jimmy Glo up in his Swisher
Never been the one to save the day, I'm the one clutchin' on the Drac'
Make sure he don't get away, a opp the only thing I chase
In a full race the back of his neck, hit the ground to decay
Walk up to him, C Grape stood over, put one in his face
Murkin' what my soul say
I'm slidin' with this throwaway
My heater for a cold day, leave a nigga in disarray
Better stay up in the house like the nigga from That's So Raven
Catch that nigga walkin' out, we in the bushes, we been waiting
Never send a threat on the internet just to prove a point
That dissin', don't get into that, we leavin' that to the informants
Don't inform me about who informing, that's yo' final warning
7.62s sting like a Bumblebee, he start transforming
Send yo' homies on the drill, but they ain't never make it back
Shoot up the scat, we left it flat, he died on the impact
My shooter, he a gym rat, but never mentioned til' we crashed
We put you on the news, and I bet his family viewed that

Ayy, smilin' on my mugshot 'cause I know my bond money good
I ain't missed a heartbeat, I'm out the next day, it's understood
To the Broward County Police, lick my nuts and suck my wood
First day tray and nigga you start mugging, wish a nigga would
Doing donuts in the SRT, I crashed into a tree
Rolls truck the next week, money ain't been shit to me
Ridin' with a full clip, but the gas tank on E
Slidin' like a cruise ship, wet you up like a jet ski
Livin' to a hundred and three, that's the OG Grape in me
Auntie wanna pray for me, better pray for my enemies
Life ain't gave me lemons so I start clutchin' the lemon squeeze
Had a AR F15, and two Glocks, .223's

Never send a threat on the internet just to prove a point
That dissin', don't get into that, we leavin' that to the informants
Don't inform me about who informing, that's yo' final warning
7.62s sting like a Bumblebee, he start transforming
Send yo' homies on the drill, but they ain't never make it back
Shoot up the scat, we left it flat, he died on the impact

Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere

Be tryna show love in private 'cause
They done told people they don't fuck with you in public and shit
That shit be crazy
I don't be understandin' that shit, niggas be feelin'
Slick way about bitches and
Come on man, if we ain't about no money, what we doin'? (Speak)

I done overplayed my part, they forgot about me, amnesia (It's cool though)
I done hit yours, you done hit mine, why you still mad? We even (I ain't on that)
The blogs put up anything (Shit made up), and the crazy part they believe 'em (For )
Nigga caught a charge and got locked up, only reason dude still breathin' (I swear)
I never make a hoe feel like I can't do no better than her (Who?)
Heard that she got a new nigga, my bag the biggest
She said he don't fuck how I fuck (Haha)
Bitch lied on God and her kids
Threw me off, damn, that fucked up my trust

Watch you draw the line, so stay over there
Don't come 'round the gang, don't throw up the set

All that, ""You love me"", shit ain't genuine
And I felt the vibe when I walked in
Shit slick, hurt me thinkin' you solid then I saw you bend
Even after they true colors show, kept it real on my end
That wasn't my beef at first, I made it mine
'Cause me and bruh locked-in (For life and after)
When I say we la familia, we la familia, we locked in for life
Shit, loyalty over love
We gon' keep it real first
Like you not gon' see me fuckin' with my nigga opp
I don't give a fuck if I knew, his opp longer than him
Niggas'll hate you so much, they can know you'll opp a rat
And still hang with 'em
Don't that make them the same nigga?
Shit, let me know I need clarification
What part of the game is that?
See, I know what need to be done

So I set my bar real low

I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad

But I'm way less sad
But I'm way less sad

I wake up
And I'm not so mad at Twitter now
Living sucks
But it's sucking just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you lovе it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
I may bе wrong, I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad

Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm trying too hard, but I can't not try
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad"

Levitating,Dua Lipa ,"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together

Rapstar,Polo G,"(Shout out my nigga Synco)

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished"
interlude,J Cole,"Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"

Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused

If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, ""Bitch, guess what?
All the rich-ass boys wanna fuck on us!""
All this ass sittin' up, you could look, don't touch
In our bag, bussin' bands every time we link up

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (Alright), she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (Oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, if you need a freak
I ain't dumb, but motherfucker, she my Tweedledee
If she ride for me (Ride), she don't need a key
If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot, said, ""Mm-mm, don't go there""
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air
Whole world wanna be us
And my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
Let's celebrate 'cause we the baddest in the club

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"
Heartbreak Anniversary,Giveon,"Ooh

Balloons are deflated

We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever

Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused

Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' fourties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim

Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool

On Me,Lil Baby,"(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""

Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one

The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time

Your Power,Billie Eilish,"Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change

Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"
Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Hearts breakin'
I'm a product of my

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name

Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"

Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?

Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions

Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know

My hands up shaking just to let you know now
You've got a higher power
You've got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour

When for so long I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh"
Good Days,SZA,"Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind"

Saying baby, take me home
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you

Streets,Doja Cat,"I've been goin' through some things (Oh)
I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""

Glad You Exist,Dan + Shay,"Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

Trying to fight through the daylight

I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days

All I Know So Far,P!nk,"Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway

I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth

You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far

So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line

You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far

That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far

I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up
Yeah
When it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up
'Til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars

Down To One,Luke Bryan,"We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
Down to one
I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""

Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"
Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady"
Single Saturday Night,Cole Swindell,"I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin' you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain’t a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin’ out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasn’t looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for


Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night"
Hard For The Next,Moneybagg Yo & Future,"I just bought that chick a Patek
I ain't love her, but I just had to show her status
I just bought that bitch a Patek

Bought that bitch a Patek
I ain't love her, I just stepped up her status
Got her cookin' in the crib without no panties
I just jumped off the lear like a savage
I done turned another one of 'em up knowing I'm careless
I can't have love for these hoes who crabbin'
Saint Laurent my attire, made it a habit
I got more than one, I done made it a habit
And I wanna know if you gon' be there when I need you (Oh, oh)

You fuckin' with a gangsta this timе
Less than fifty in her Birkin then shе ain't one of mine (No)
Adding brightness to your glow, they see the difference in your shine
Codependent, long as you got me you never in a bind, Nate
A nigga go ape shit 'bout you, primate
A drinker not a smoker but for me you hit that pound cake
They say I started somethin' when I had gave you the Lamb'
And other shit they can't see 'cause everything ain't for the 'Gram (Shh)
I put it down
I don't know who need to hear this, another nigga could never
Spoilin' her too easy, make it harder for the next one
I'd rather put her on game than run it on her (Run it on her)
If you can put up with me, you a fuckin' soldier (Gangsta)
You one of them one (My whole life has changed, the one)
It's the Maybach drive itself for me, I better not touch the wheel in this car
You one of them one  (You were that special one, one)
This the life when you lovin' a star, no cap, I'm just

Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to trust you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to love you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to please you (Oh, yeah)

Get my attention, inspire me  in a see through
I need to be careful 'bout energy I feed you
I did it to her on a jet, it felt so lethal
I feed you racks, feed you racks, like seafood
I know shawty admire me but I had to ghost her
Must've happened right after the time, after I post her
I'm puttin' this worldwide splash on some local
She had my attention from the first time I approached her
I'm puttin' two-tone on her wrist and on her choker
She a hottie, she a baddie, she a smoker
I've been contemplating ‘bout it, buyin' a roaster
Tryna get to know her
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to spoil you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to trust you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to love you
Makin' it harder for the next nigga to please you

La Noche de Anoche,Bad Bunny & Rosalia,"Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar

Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio

I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)

Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon

Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Ayy), I did it, I did it, I did it

Take it off then bend over, let me see it
If you're lookin' for a trill type bitch, let me be it
I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich
Talkin' down on me don't make you the shit
How my name in your mouth more than your spit?
I really encourage my haters to talk
Throwin' that shade only keepin' me lit, huh
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

Hey, goddammit, I get it
They don't like to see when we win, but I did it
Hey, I stand by my city
Chopsticks sound like a guitar in the air
Stop and take a picture when I'm jumpin' off a Lear
I done ran it up, it only took a couple years
The money be callin', if it wasn't for my lil' partner
Then the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear
New sports car go, ""Vroom,"" switch gears
Hey, how you? Goddamn, come here
Thought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, ""For what?""
I got ten karats each in my left and right ears
'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer
My climax ain't even nowhere near it
I stayed down and I stayed down
And I came up, I had faith in my spirit
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Go), I did it, I did it, I did it

Diamonds on my neck
New contract, I ain't signin' that ho yet
Private plane flyin' somewhere, smilin' on the jet
I drop hit after hit, now that's the domino effect
These niggas out here goin' flat
Ain't no stoppin' it, pink and blue paper all day like Monopoly
Brand new Pradas, I'm proud of me
Actually came from the bottom
Ain't no need in even askin' me, ain't even seen the half of me
And ain't no passin', that's a no-go
Start them killer player niggas out here throwin' low blows
I done got good with the shit
I tell the paparazzi, ""Get my angle,"" every time they take my photo (Another one)

Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it"
Botella Tras Botella,Gera MX + Christian Nodal,"Botella tras botella ando tomando pa' olvidarme de ella (Pa' olvidarme de ella)

Pero yo no puedo (Yo no puedo)
Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero
Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo
Los tragos me saben mejor así

Estaba pensando en llamarte, yo te miro por todas partes
Pero ya no nos vemos, puede que lo olvidemos
Dos tragos y vuelvo a pensarte
Me aferro, no quiero olvidarte
Sentimientos ajenos, los celos no son buenos
Y si me llamas contesto, aunque nunca va a pasar eso
(Aunque nunca va a pasar eso)
Ya mejor ni te molesto, porque sé que vuelvo a joderlo
(Ahuevo que vuelvo a joderlo)
Y ahora que ando tomando bebida me siento triste, ya va a amanecer
A vece' borracho las penas se olvidan, pero nunca te dejé de querer
Fui mal partido, querida, todas mis pedas marcándote al cel
Le puse sal a la herida, cómo quisiera volver al ayer
Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti
(Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti)
Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD

Botella tras botella vo'a tomarme pa' acordarme de ella (Pa' acordarme de ella)

Tampa,Cico P,"Goddamn, lil' bitch on that coke like Montana
I'm a phantom
Ayy
(TrenchWerk)

Goddamn, lil' bitch on that coke like Montana
I'm on hydrocodeine, I'ma float like a phantom
Baby need some protein, work her out like a dancer
I got all the hoes and the snow just like Santa
And we keep the sticks and the smoke, who want cancer?
Knockin' at that door, lil' nigga, you gon' get a answer
Goddamn, baby, you got cakes like a Pamper
All about a buck, baby, bae, just like Tampa

Mane, that boy lil' boogie, dawg ass, got no manners
Yeah, you got some ass, but I can't fuck 'cause I got standards
Don't watch me, better watch TV, yo' bitch might change the channel
Shе was finna tell you she in love wit' mе, but I don't think you can handle
All black the coupe from the Chevy to the Phantom
Pop up wit my ru, that's Lil Heck, he from Atlanta
I might drop a deuce of purple stuff up in my Fanta
I can't leave the crib unless I know I got the blammer
Hit her wit' that hammer, if I don't she throw a tantrum
Go on, bend it over, make it clap, this yo' anthem
Run up on me, you gon' levitate like a phantom
Keep knockin' at that door, lil' nigga, you gon' get a answer
Goddamn, lil' bitch on that coke like Montana
I'm on hydrocodeine, I'ma float like a phantom
Baby need some protein, work her out like a dancer
I got all the hoes and the snow just like Santa
And we keep the sticks and the smoke, who want cancer?
Knockin' at that door, lil' nigga, you gon' get a answer
Goddamn, baby, you got cakes like a Pamper
All about a buck, baby, bae, just like Tampa

That boy bad news, he a menace to society
Everybody a rider, but I ain't had nobody ride for me
Everybody looking out, but ain't nobody had a eye for me
Shit ain't even that deep and you still chose to lie to me
Damn, you must think a nigga brazy
Lil' bitch, what's your motive? I hope you ain't tryna play me
Walk it like I talk it, I keep ten on the pavement
Smoke got me coughing, off the cup, I'm steady dazin'
Been hot for a minute, I been motherfuckin' blazin'
Mind been on the Benjis, steady motherfuckin' chasin'
I can sense that sucka shit just off the conversation
He doin' all that wolfin', guess he tryna be a patient

Goddamn, lil' bitch on that coke like Montana
I'm on hydrocodeine, I'ma float like a phantom
Baby need some protein, work her out like a dancer
I got all the hoes and the snow just like Santa
And we keep the sticks and the smoke, who want cancer?
Knockin' at that door, lil' nigga, you gon' get a answer
Goddamn, baby, you got cakes like a Pamper

Big Gangsta,Kevin Gates,"Put the soda on it, see what it do
Yeah, all night, all night
A hunnid of 'em, just sold it all (Take it, cook it soft)
Drop all on it pouring all all and all ayy
Whatever tell nigga to bring me my pink phone, ya heard me?
A hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
She wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love
She say, ""I only get excited when the pack touch down""
Pray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

Hold up
Gimme that money, lil' nigga, you knowin' that I'ma do right with it
Private charter, they snortin' that tartar, I got 'em surrounded by white women
I got 'em looking like Paris Hilton
Each one of my teeth got a carat in it (Bling)
Ayy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick
Luca Brasi, I'ma speak for him

Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
She wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love
She say, ""I only get excited when the pack touch down""
Pray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

These nigga showing me anger, they takin' it out on me
Hit the booth after I hang up with Maceió Hazis
I really fuck with dude, for real
Disruptive behavior eluded me
Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit
Caught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big
Tell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this
I got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic
My partner denied me, this bitch tried to bite me, he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em
(Well, damn)
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
She wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love
She say, ""I only get excited when the pack touch down""
Pray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all"

Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

Oh-oh
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Ooh
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again"
Minimum Wage,Blake Shelton,"Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' up with the Jones'
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage


You can make a six pack on the carpet

Good 4 U,Olivia Rodrigo,"(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby

Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Peaches,Justin Bieber ,"I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)

And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)

I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
(I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)

95.south,J Cole,"100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams ""The Battlefield""""The Battlefield"" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience ""H20""98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean ""Don't Play""97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples ""Rain""96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA ""West Savannah""95. Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins	ft Joey Bada$$ ""Jerome""93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q ""2 On""92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens ""Better In Tune With The Infinite""91. Big K.R.I.T. ""King Of The South""90. PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought ""The Imperial""85. O.T Genasis	""CoCo""BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy ""Nate""83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign ""Deliver""82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West ""Can't Stop""81. Future ft. Andre 3000 ""Benz Friends (Whatchutola)""80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj ""***Flawless Remix""78. ScHoolboy Q ""Prescription/Oxymoron""77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Mamacita""76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q ""I Just Wanna Party""75. Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods	""Sunday Candy""The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.
Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion
One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room
Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release
The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""
Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind."
Save Your Tears,The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,"Ooh (Ooh)

Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean

I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King

That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it

Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up

Steady thinking bout the franklins

In the most disrespectful way I can spit it to you
All that shit you say you wishin' a nigga would do, niggas did it to you
I'll leave a hole big enough to fit a midget through
I'ma introduce the world to a clown
And I don't need help from Steven King to present It to you
Steven King Presents It, oh it's a different vibe
All that Champion Of The Year money, this clown ass nigga still don't know how to use his penny wise (Pennywise)
But when me and Jimmie rock, Suge the shooter and driver, watch how the Hemi slide
Shotgun out the window in Compton, the same alley where Ricky died
Oh nah that was South Central
So I let a round hit you from a loud pistol
When I could quietly stab you in the navel and just drag what's in the south, central
Out in Compton, I'll roll in ya neighborhood, hippie vibes
Six shooter, old man revolver, but I give a 60, five
Oh but you Nutty Blocc, you Compton Crip, my mistake then
You still bang the Six God, you'll get beat wit' a .40 ain't talkin' Drake friend
Ain't no beast to unleash you just be caged in
How I'ma believe the bars your pen state when it took you this long to get past the bars in the state pen'?
But you Nutty Blocc, Compton Crip, big C's you throwin' 'round
'Til you assigned a wheelchair for the rest of ya life, pussy  you Rolling now
I'll grab ya bitch head, while she bobbin' for apples and push her nose in now
Why? Cause I promised Gotti if he went back to jail I would hold you down
Oh but you big Crip? But you give me no option
How I'm supposed to believe your set run the west when half the world includin' the neutral niggas refer to yo' city as ""Bompton""
Let a nigga say they from ""Bewark, New Jersey""
Nigga that semi go choppin'
Smack, Chico, Beasley, Avoca- ain't no fuckin' video's droppin'
I make a movie wit' the toaster, shotgun in the armpit
Kick back gon' make me do the Lil' Uzi wit' the shoulder straps
I would've brought a TEC wit' a 100 clip just so I could give him a Hot 97
And niggas wonder why I Flex
I'm from a city where mothers die for sets
I really live what's in my notebook pussy, my life a Butterfly Effect
I said, nigga don't talk that street shit to the concrete
Cause I laid the foundation and paved the way for you Prodigy's to be able to cause Havoc and even Mobb Deep
Nigga my .9 speak
I pull up on Gotti at five guys, we nine deep
Hmm, now I beat y'all all of this hair on his side burns; Ashanti
I'll get this dummy shot, both arms up, I'm doin' the Mummy Bop
My whole avenue retarded, ""Me, I'm really from Nutty Blocc""
Now if we heard Gotti shootin', what he playin'? Prolly 2K
For nigga keep goin' back to jail on purpose, what that mean to y'all? Prolly he gay
Ya mother said you can be anything you put ya mind to, right? And she proud of you, hey
Well I could give a fuck what ya ma-ma-mama said bitch, you ain't Bobby Boucher
So don't talk to me like I'm stupid, cause your Tommy unemployed
Bitch I ain't Cole
Stab wound through his chest, then push the bullet through the same hole
I never went down, cause I never got caught, my niggas ain't told
Why? Cause I do my shit all by my lonely like I'm J. Cole
I don't wanna know what ya life like
Or what ya stain in ya hood and what your stripes like
Just know that I got triple what they paid you, plus PayPerView, so what's your price like?
Kimbo Slice, Miami backyard, I'm tryin' to fight fight
Kevin Hart told me Gotti the nigga tryin' to go night night
Now I tried to show you that there's a better you nigga
A side of you that you never knew
I'ma show you how involving yourself in the beef will turn you to a vegetable
Nigga you ever have real fiends beggin' you for the residue?
I'm from a city where niggas will literally chop ya neck off ya shoulder just to say they got ahead of you
You talkin' like you play wit' birds?
Nigga, ya dead homies got what they deserved
I came to Compton just to spit in ya mother mouth and smoke my favorite herb
Now you in front of the judge and you don't play with verbs
Stupid nigga got convicted for everything he was up against
Y'all tryin' to convince me that he got a way with words
Man my shit is real and you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick! And let these people believe them lies
Nigga time!
Nigga that shit was fire!
For real, he was spittin' some retarded shit
Up here dressed like a 'How To Be A Crip' starter kit
Nigga you'se a bitch!
Do somethin', I'll really shoot somethin'
Cross my line, and I'll shut the Volume down like a mute button
Nigga you stuntin'
I liked you better back in them Grind Time mode
But this the URL, this my shit now
And ever since I been the Champ, all these niggas want smoke
I don't see no lies told
Ask Smack
Soon as these niggas come to the crib, I'm the first thing they ask about like the wi-fi code
Nigga y'all like hoes, be in ya inner circle's whisperin' 'bout me
'Til you meet me and realize you just a 300 and I'm a Bentley
Breakfast Club ass niggas, y'all see (C) Da God and envy
You be on D shit, shout out to them Damu's
Y'all know how we do
My real niggas know if I holla ""Asante""
See now if he knew, he would've hollered out """"
But see that's why I got a question Crippin', this a lesson given
You need to figure out if gang bangin' was yo' best decision
See the west is listenin'
Just like we supposed to, cause you from New Jersey and Grape Street
So do you got a problem with the east coast too?
Cause Grape Street beef wit' the east coast, but you from the east coast
Ain't that like a conflict of interest?
I guess what's happenin' in Watts ain't none of y'all niggas business
Y'all niggas bitches, you a hoe Ars'
Gotti let the fo' spark
Catch him in his whip, I'll turn that bitch to a go kart
Headshot, need the locks on the do'; I'm Joe Clark
You don't want no part
I already bodied Suge, now Arsonal comin' straight for a vengeance
It ain't jelly when I say I got some artificial Grapes on my biscuits
Y'all be my witness
I'ma need two caskets, Red can get it too since you yappin'
But his apple in a box with the Grapes, it's a fruit basket
Nigga I'm spazzin', Gotti got the juice now
Mix Red's blood on top of Grapes and make it Fruit Town
Nigga you clowns, I'm a real nigga, that shit ain't on me, bitch the shit in me
Gun under the chin, leave a hole that exit out the top, that shit a chimney
It offend me, when you be actin' like you from them JD projects, but ain't put on none of them niggas
But you on the rap game makin' money for one of JD's projects
But I guess, I'll let the .40 bank heads, that's if he outta line
Lemon squeeze in his face, it's our (sour) time
The bottom line, I got a lot of ways I can murder him
If I'm choosing where to shoot, I'ma pick his locks like a burglary
The nerve of me, I'm back on that dumb shit
Hand gun with the drum clip, I'm dumpin' the .40, I want a young bitch
Nigga, one hit, will have his mind gone, he brain dead
Now a machine help him with his words like Rhymezone
Nigga we in different time zones
I'm on that Pacific time, grippin' mine
If this don't work, Twork voice, I got a bigga .9
This a crime
I was in jail when my patna got shot, DOA
I'm talkin' he didn't get away to the doctor
I came home to put in work for him, feelin' just like Meek in a helicopter
Cause I got out and went straight to a chopper
You in the face of a mobster!
I'll have every nigga here stretch him
Pistol whip, blunt force to the face, this peer pressure
These niggas talkin', well I'ma keep on talkin'
Nina sparkin', I've been on so many missions, bitch I'm tired of guns, I got heat exhaustion
This nigga's a fuckin' bus driver
Rappin' gangsta shit
I don't believe the nonsense, I'll show up to your job and pop on campus, it's a parent teacher conference
Nigga we believe in violence
I'll catch ya bitch and let the lead pop
All I heard was ""ooh"" ""ah"" ""eh"" before the headshot
The same bitch with different Screams; Sidney Prescott
The TEC's cocked, I get ya granny goin' to bed, put the silencer on it so the sound gone
If I let it spray, think ""graduation day"", that old bitch gettin' caped wit' her gown on
You a clown bro, Shoebox saved you in Detroit, that's the only reason you around us bro
I came from shootouts, bustin' 'til there ain't shit comin' out this hoe
I'm sayin', we both been saved by the Cal' befo'
And when it's-
Y'all can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time
Nigga suck my dick! For the second time
And now I said it to your face Crip
This like workplace harassment
I violate all your personal space bitch
I'm that cousin always on punishment, I'm not the nigga you can play wit'
So what I'm from the east nigga, gang bangin' is gang bangin', we on the same shit
I ain't new to this, I've been bangin' half my life, you must be misinformed
Oh I get it, I hardly, it hardly rain in southern California so you think we weather a different storm
Y'all know why me and this Ray Swag in the face ass nigga ain't never gon' get along?
Because you'd rather go to jail than break yo' mama heart showin' you tough, provin' some other niggas wrong
You still tryin' to prove you tough when you ride wit' yo' city
You said it yo'self you in the Grandee's 24/7 nigga
So when you gonna spend some time wit' yo' kids?
Yo youngest son really miss his daddy
And yo' patna teachin' him how to hold a gun
It's funny you spent more time in jail with yo' bunkie, but didn't spend that much time outside wit' yo' oldest son
See, who don't spend time wit' they kids, I don't support those
It's my job to fire, and leave you dead in your ""showin' up to court clothes.""
Niggas who think they Nutty on my Blocc, I extort those
All you hear is a loud BANG, remind you of how that county cell door close
Gettin' locked up is easy nigga
I can do some shit right now that's gon' land me in jail
Why is it so hard for you niggas to realize bein' absent from your kids life will leave them damaged as well?
You out here glorifyin' incarceration, this nigga scared to get mail
Nigga I give you five years tops 'til you and your oldest son together sharin' a cell
Nigga what?!
You think that jail shit scare me now?
Naw, what's scary is bein' the only nigga free in yo' hood and you gotta take care of all of yo' homies' families now
I'm on the phone with my nigga that's never comin' home
Tellin' him I just let his granny down
Nigga I come to Cali just to walk on yo' grass pussy, you Stanley now
Nigga you gon' meet karma
My hands speak fast and my reach longer
I never went to prison and I stayed free, so who really been on these streets longer?
Oh, oh oh, I'll slap this bitch, now it's gettin' domestic
You standin' there wit' yo' head down and yo' hands behind yo' back
You that used to gettin' arrested?
All that time you spent away from your two boys? I blame the game for it
But God already made him pay for it
They gave him life in the insane asylum, and they assigned him to the A. Ward
I'ma be straight forward, I'ma son of a gun, my mama was ratchet
But she told me, ""Never speak about ya pops.""
I ain't never tell on a soul, nothin' to speak about the cops
You got one style of rap nigga, you don't speak about a lot
But I get it, you wrote all your bars in prison you don't really know how to think outside the box
Nigga ya whole life was tied to the system
Stupid, you always guilty, DUH
That's why you rhyme with conviction
You look the part so ya lines in convincin'
Low cut, fucked up teeth Crip
Nigga you match beyond the description
And the nigga on Youtube, he got- he- he like, ""Yo, welcome to my hood. This the trap trap
The building over there on 165 and 166, oh that's where they make the packs at
Oh yeah that alley over there when the cops run down it's where we throw the straps at.""
Dispatch on the other line like, ""10-4 did you catch that?""
He ain't done he still goin', he said, ""Yo aye cuz, this wall right here cuz, it's full of dead homies I wish I could bring back to life
Lil' Half A Slice, on Nutty man he was a killer. He lived the savage life.""
He said, ""Aye cuz, what he'd kill, 'bout ten niggas before he made the sacrifice?""
Nigga you tellin' everything, you out here gettin' niggas indited in the after-life
Ya name ""Bay Loc""
You a fat Derrick Rose, man you gon' stay broke
And a victim of the system
No anesthesia through this incision, we need you to stay woke
Nigga, I'm here to snatch every bit of saliva out ya bae throat
Hit once then make the bitch disappear like she Def Loaf
Now between me and Gotti, it's a distance
You from where gang bangin' originated, so why I'm
{Stream cuts out}
Between me and Gotti it's a distance
Cause you went from where gang bangin' originated, but I'm more world wide known for this Crippin'
I'm Crip, you gon' be disabled there's a difference
Your bitch gotta take my dick twice a day after she eat, my shit prescription
Some shit'll never change, I'm super Crip
In my car I got the handicap sign up and everythang
That mean I get to park closer to ya job givin' me the aim
Dessy rang, I'm hittin' innocent by-standards,  I ain't got deadly aim
So I cut him in slow-mo
Word to Dobo, I put that on everythang
I go berserk on him
Bury his body I throw the dirt on him
I set him up, I had my unemployed bitch throw the work on him
Catch ya spirit headed to the afterlife, I throw the scope on him
But I ain't pull the trigger, old fashioned ass whoopin'
Beat him wit' the stick until it broke on him
He a rat, I put the cheese on his head like he from Green Bay
You the man? Well not 'round here, nigga Dikembe
Boy, the way I do you with this fourth and inches, just watch the replay
I'ma keep on cuttin' him and bringin' him back like I was a DJ
I'll put the muzzle on it, then I aim .9
What that mean? I kill him and give that moment of silence at the same time
As long as he get hospitalized tonight, I'll remain calm
Cause honestly, Gotti he could Die Another Day word to James Bond
My shit is real, you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick and let these niggas believe yo' lies
Nigga time!

All these, behind bars bars, was the type of shit you had niggas laughin' 'bout
I find it funny, how you could condemn me cause I'm goin' to jail for the shit you be rappin' 'bout
I got you niggas bangin' again
If y'all wasn't doin' it then, nigga don't be doin' it now
Tryin' to show me you gangsta, only make me think you niggas clowns
Even the vets, talk all that shit about the PG process
Then get on the card with me and all of a sudden it's the Proving Grounds
Nigga, you'se a clown
You was a Blood I heard that turned Grape Street
That's some weird shit
I knew he was a fag, cause only queers switch
Nigga real shit, you a bitch in the streets but you wanna be a Crip in the ring
Arm to his chest, look like his shit in a sling
This bitch wit' a beam
I'll steam his face, nigga I'll kill ya kid, now you a seedless Grape
Ain't no need to hate nigga, y'all straight bitches
The only battle rappers from Grape Street, is Aktive and Dre Vishiss
Tryin' to act like Grape a hood that you love
You givin' him three up top but you never booked him on UDubb!
Nigga, I'm disrespectful just like cuz, except the bars heavy
I'll kidnap ya daughter, you find her Trapped In The Closet wit' R. Kelly
Yeah I'm disrespectful, you ain't gon' do a damn thang 'bout it
I'll kill that lil' bitch, show up to her funeral, get her obituary, make a paper plane out it
Yo' little girl, that's ya world? You better keep her out my way aight
I usually don't hit kids, but today I might
Choke her, 'til you got a Blueface baby, 'Yeah Aight'
You goddamn right, I'll put the blade to his daughter's scalp
Make sure that lil' bitch in pain
How the fuck y'all callin' Arsonal ""Da Rebel"" but I'm the one goin' against the grain
This shit insane
Ya baby mama look good, ooh them tits soft
After I fuck her I use his daughter clothes to wipe my dick off
I'm disrespectful, I'm tryin' to figure him out
I hope on them field trips they say, ""This dude nuts""
I hope on them field trips you catch yo' daughter givin' head on the back of ya school bus
This dude nuts
I been tryin' to figure him out
I seen his daughter, I said ""You would never succeed (suck seed) until somebody bust they kids in ya mouth!""
Look what he did for the clout!
He been rappin' like that 15+
I can't remember a time he was lyrical
The King Of Disrespect? He ain't got enough respect for the craft to write fire material
I'm tired of hearin' you
I don't even think you no real nigga, I can tell by yo' demeanor
You became a bus driver cause you ain't have the smarts to be a teacher
Nigga you a leecher
Ride every nigga wave that you close to
Scream Fetty Wap name all last year, he ain't even post you
You a weirdo
Portrayed to be a Loc by your peers though
I know ya fears bro
You wear that purple flag so in Cali you got a spot for protection
But tell these niggas how when you in Cali you scared to even go to ya section
Nigga look in the mirror
I be he see a hoe in the reflection
I'm talkin' real shit, ain't nothin' outta context
If he wasn't a rapper, he wouldn't have even stepped foot in them projects
But I guess, he better be glad he can rap
Cause you ain't no shooter from them Bricks, that's an actual fact
But since you can rap and you bangin' they shit puttin' 'em on
They let him do it, they just gotta tax you for that
It's tax season! The whole projects claimin' him as a dependent
Payin' grown men for protection, that gotta be weird
Tell Suge he should be cool showin' up now, they show love to big bitches 'round this time of the year
We not the same!
I really had to put in work for my name
True story, I done really put niggas on shirts for the game
This nigga made a game; Arsonal's Revenge
(Aye, for real they gon' buy that shit)
Arsonal's Revenge, aye but that don't mean he 'bout his business or his wealth
It's just like I been tellin' y'all
He good at creatin' an image for himself
Yeah you bang Grape Street but in Watts you be scared faggot, I know ya story
Can't show up to the projects without a care package
Every time he come over there, shit be feelin' like Christmas
Got him givin' out money and free Fetty Wap tickets
How he talkin' Grape Street like he really wit' that
If he was, how come when Suge got robbed he ain't get his shit back?
Grape Street that nigga, Grape Street this
Them niggas took ya phone and ya motherfuckin' jewelry, you ain't been back on Grape Street since
He had trouble wit' that
Brand new .50, I can't even feel the kickback
This a clean cal', you can tell by the Gun Title it got a Double Impact
Nigga if you ain't shootin' shit, you can't even talk to Gotti
I'm a walkin' homi
Nigga believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
They prolly don't even understand what I'm talkin' prolly
Cause the news said I dropped a nigga, that was a lie
I caught the body!
And when it's real, y'all tell
(You can see it in they eyes
Go head, it's yo' turn, make them nigga believe them lies
Nigga time)

Nigga suck my dick! Third times a charm
I thought you would've swung by now
This nigga ain't got no fight left in him, he like, ""He already won by now.""
I admire you knowin' you couldn't beat me but him still try
But you popped up at the wrong time, that's an in-field fly
Meaning ya hitter out immediately
Ya runners? Lookin' hesitant
12, 13, 14 letters of the alphabet, Gotti you way outta ya element
Get ya bars up, I don't get stuck in the moment, I'll leave a star struck
Serve him through the window early morn', ""Welcome to Starbucks""
Gun spark, light flash, you think a photo man behind ya
No! Tommy in his face barkin' in his face like, ""I don't know no damn Kiana.""
I'ma be real wit' niggas
Smack and Beasley, they tryin' to build a nigga
Code word 
They fly me in to give a meal (mil') to niggas
Telekinesis powers when I'm mad, I Matilda niggas
I got still for niggas, meet my New Edition, I'm Johnny Gill wit' niggas
BOOM! Through ya front door, knock ya bitch up, then pick her up
Put the deuce to his head like I was tryin' to fuck the picture up
Show up to the funeral, reach in the casket and grab ya sister butt
Cause my first name ""I Don't"", last name ""Give A Fuck""
AKA Durrell ""Disrespectful"" Jones
I'm not ya friend brother
I'll slap the dog shit outta you and ya friend mother
How many times you copped out at court? Let's not pretend brother
You would've been a house nigga, and I can tell by ya skin color
Nigga my tool is chunky, ya father fell in love with a foolish junkie
I stay ten toes down with my fuckin' chin up, I don't care who confront me
You a flunky and ya whole hood green
That's why ya son remind me of the lil' nigga H&M had referred to as the ""coolest monkey""
I wish I was the doctor standin' in-between ya bitch legs when she was givin' birth
Cause that would've solidified my spot as the one nigga who get to smack that lil' nigga first
Yeah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
You want a birth death?
I almost kill him on purpose just to say him and watch him struggle through his first breaths
Soon as the nigga 'bout to walk, I clip him before he take his first steps
Him and his other brother, they competin' who gon' have the worst death
Rebel shit
This level of success, you will never get
Special Olympics, I'm here to show y'all who the better Crip
Grape Street, we the gang
Speak in vain, heaters bang
We Crippin' form a different point of view, we don't see the same
Nigga, to me you still a tiny Loc nigga
So take this L and let that L sit
You came in here lookin' for Ars' and got Durrell bitch
I'm quick to let a shell kick
For goin' against the grain, what I'm raising (raisin) will put a Nut' in the bag we makin' trail mix
But you don't even think like that
Last night in Le Palace you yellin', ""Anything possible"" and you don't even drink like that
I'll walk up in ya son's school
Go to the oldest lil' nigga class
Rex ad lib, yell ""That nigga dead!"" when he say he miss his dad
Man, in front of his classmates I'll fuckin' whip his ass
Man, and then walk downstairs and tell ya younger son, ""Go stand in the street in front of that hell cat.""
Then I did the dash
Y'all wanna know what happened next?
I hit his ass!
I knocked him so far back he flew into the Ghost Of Christmas Past
Last time the nigga seen his daddy, he had to kiss the glass
Next time gon' be to identify him and zip the bag
I said, my bitch toughened up
I ain't gotta shoot or do an uppercut
Code word: Orgasm
(What that mean?)
She was trained to squirt and bust a Nut'

Talk naaasty!

He said, she said, I don't care what niggas said 'bout him
One day he true blue, BAOW! Next mornin' niggas read (red) 'bout him (bottom)
Baow! Baow! Baow! Another one blew (blue)
Blaow! And it knocked all of the red out him
Then you gon' see a Grape Street Crip moonwalkin' through the blood just to say I did it in red bottoms
Now if I pull up, it's gon' be Glocks involved
Mops and all, I'm lettin' rockets off
{Cell phone sound} Brrrrrrrt
The doctor makin' a Compton call
Surgery! Blottin' up his exit wounds with cotton balls
You just sell wigs, I get paid to knock 'em off!
I said, is we talkin' colors here? Or your profession and how you color hair?
I'll slap ya nephew in front of ya mother to see if ya brother care
Somebody please dare me to do it
(I dare you)
Do I hear a double dare?
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
Ya bitch mouth had my finger, dick and balls in it
She did it in front of ya house and didn't even give a fuck, cause the car tinted
We had a gang bang last night...she was involved in it
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

Last round it's on-

Nah, sike I lied nigga
No, sike I lied nigga
Sike you died nigga
You made ten thousand dollars
Ten thou- man that's pocket change
You know what happened when they Dow jumped?
Man, let's just say I'm tied into the stock exchange
I mean, you said I was on tour, I was gettin' a lot of money with Fetty Wap and thangs
Where your Champion Of The Year money?
Cause I got a whole lot of gwap and thangs
You got Champion Of The Year money, why don't you put it to your ear dummy
This ""Trapion"" Of The Year money
Time nigga

Aye, y'all just seen that stack that this nigga pulled out?
That's a whole lot of money that he made from this art form
I hope after you die today, you give a little bit of that money to ya BM and ya daughter, that can be a nice lil' start for 'em
I mean you gotta give 'em somethin', cause I heard the stories
They said you barely for 'em
I'm just sayin', they bitches better pray they in ya will (wheel) like a car horn
Nitty already buried Suge
Now these niggas finna get a casket together
Said he ain't know Shotgun...they up here rappin' together
Y'all the fakest of friends
Headshot, when I say, ""The doc tryin' to patch things up"", he ain't makin' amends
Ain't no shakin' my hand
You do a whole lotta weak shit
In the field, the strap got no safety, we in goal line defense
They said ""Bro ain't got a weakness"" that's 'til the can' clap you
Hospital beds, rubber bands wrap you
His family like, ""How he doin'?""
I don't know, he just popped up on the 'tube, he a Banned battle
Nigga I'm from Nutty Blocc, this shit deeper than just a tattoo
You slapped the hat off Iron, I'll grab the iron and slap you!
That's a fact too, you a lil' boy to me Arsonal
Gave him the .9, the .40 and then the chopper
Just thought he needed a little more in him Arsonal (arsenal)
Fuck Arsonal though, cause if Ray Swag was here I would've shot him right in front of you
I would've gave him two in his brains
Niggas would've been yellin' for you to get ya dawg (dog) like he was loose from the chain
Nigga what you do for the game?
Niggas know I be in Compton with the Crips
AK's really poppin' and shit
Marshall Lawrence, the way we had to chop into bricks
Nigga I'm hittin' licks
A young nigga, makin' racks, I'm just statin' facts
The Feds was hot, I had to play the back
I'm just sayin', the pigs was all over ya dawg (dog), I was bakin' raps (bacon wraps)
Nigga face the facts
How you supposed to be a killer, but you ain't killed nothin' or drilled nothin'?
Walked in the house with blood on my shirt, told my mama I spilled somethin'
Steel dumpin', I'm still thuggin'
If they would've got the prints off the gun I wouldn't be here
You would've seen the kid do life
But I'm way too sharp like a Ginsu knife
Blue rag over the handle, that's a cloth over the grip like the lid too tight
Nigga you too light! I really came from shootouts
Check the score nigga, we up
On the missions, we just pray we make it back like the re-up
You see us, this what real Crippin' look like
You starin' at dope when it come back cooked right
I'm talkin' in the trap
Rare Breeds, we got it brick by brick
The smokers knew it was freebase like we got hit by pitch
Nigga this my shit
And these niggas be worryin' 'bout the wrong shit
Like if we should've stopped watchin' football cause of Kaepernick
Niggas die in my hood everyday, news just don't capture shit
Celebrities could talk about it, we just want 'em to do it
Crazy, while you was busy boycottin' the NFL my boy caught a bullet
I rep the gang to the fullest
I'm talkin' 'bout we shootin' 'til the lead gone
Tell the youth
""Ain't nothin' in this lifestyle but death. That's the truth.""
I be prayin' I was dead wrong
But where I'm from, when you be too hard headed, you end up a head stone
I'm from the streets, that's what they made sidewalks fo'
Niggas done really died on my block
Even standin' too close to the curb will get a nigga hit, we playin' sideline pop
Nigga I'm from the streets for real, they- aye ask about me in my hood
I was a young nigga, lettin' that lead fly shorty
I'm talkin' 16 fuckin' wit' a .40
Tell Lifetime I'm ready to tell my story
Survivin' the streets, if y'all would've seen what I seen, maaan, y'all prolly wouldn't have made it out
I'm tellin' you, this shit prolly would've made cuz quit
So many homies in the cemetery it's like they workin' graveyard shift
Nigga and I peep my nigga Knocca, sometimes I be wishin' I could go wit' him
So many niggas I done lost, I ain't got no mo' love in my heart
{Takes off his shoe}
Even my shoe ain't got a sole (soul) in 'em
Nigga every strap, got a pole in 'em
Two shots, that's why I clapped him
Another shot, body bagged him
Cause the third rounds just hit harder like when I be rappin'
It's a real life struggle everyday in the trenches
.40 goin' over my options, I'm tryin' to make a decision
Nigga Roc voice, ""It's me dawg.""
I'm from Nutty Blocc, hub in the dub, Watts
Nigga I show love to my Grape Street so free 03 and free Hogg
And when it's real y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
(Go 'head)
See if he can believe them lies
Nigga time"
Rapstar,Polo G,"(Shout out my nigga Synco)

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it

I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'

Without You,The Kid LAROI,"You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)

interlude,J Cole,"Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"
Montero (Call Me By Your Name),Lil Nas X,"I caught it bad yesterday

A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week

Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,"Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you

Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect

Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 ,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed

I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past

You buy some jewels, I buy a house and put some equity in it
Baltimore im representing, with my cd play
In essence, I be that N-i-g-g-a, wait
Unexpected journey, but I never seen the hobbit
So I had to cut you dicks off, Lorena Bobbitt
Power Trip, they think im burning solar flare cash
Cause my flow colder than a polar bear's ass
Your girl swallowed all of my kids up, I promise I didn't kiss her
Rocket booster my way out, I promise I didn't miss her

You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me"
Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature

I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto

Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"

I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next

Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

I found it hard to find someone like you

Why can't I find no one like you?

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary

Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool

When other chickens tryna get in my coop

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up

Glad You Exist,Dan + Shay,"Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause еvery high and every low lеd to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Take a moment just to take it in

Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

I could go on and on
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me

Should've never watched you go

Single Saturday Night,Cole Swindell,"I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin' you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain’t a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin’ out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasn’t looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for


Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah

Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o

Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (Bum)

Come Through,HER ,"OPENING SEQUENCE
INT. MICHAEL'S OFFICE
Jim and Michael are talking in his office
MICHAEL: All right Jim, your quarterlies look very good. How are things going at the library?
JIM: Oh, I told you. Couldn't close it, so—
MICHAEL: So you've come to the master for guidance? (imitating) Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
JIM: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
MICHAEL: All right, well, let me show you how it's done. (gets on phone) Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello! This is Michael Scott, I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you, manager-a-manager. (cut to the office and cut back) All right, done deal! Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. My mistake. (hangs up) That was a woman I was talking to. So. . .she had a very low voice. Probably a smoker. So. . .so that's the way it's done.
Cut to Michael, walking to the Dunder Mifflin logo
Michael: (to the camera) I've been in Dundler Mifflin for twelve years, the last four as regional manager. If you want to come through here, (opens the door to the main office) so we have the entire floor, so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see, ah this is our receptionist Pam. (goes to the receptionist) Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for' for ever, right Pam?
PAM: Well, I don't know!
MICHAEL: If you think she's cute now you should have seen her a couple of years ago! (makes faces)
PAM: What?
MICHAEL: Any messages?
PAM: Yeah, just a fax (hands the fax to Michael).
MICHAEL: Pam this is from corporate. How many times have I told you that there's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
PAM: You haven't told me!
MICHAEL: It's called the wastepaper basket. (throws the paper away, laughs) Look at that! Look at that face! (points to Pam)
Cut to Michael's office
MICHAEL: People say I'm the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before, you're hilarious, and you get the best out of us."" I think that pretty much sums it up (shows a mug, ""World's Best Boss"") I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Cut to Dwight, grabbing his headset, humming a song, Jim looks at the camera, helpless
Cut to Jim, talking to the camera
JIM: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply to them whether they can pay for it and... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Cut to Dwight and Jim, Michael walks to them
MICHAEL: Wazzaaaaaa?
JIM: Wazza. (to camera) He still loves that after seven years!
Michael and Dwight continue for a while
MICHAEL: (to Jim) What?
JIM: Nothing.
MICHAEL: Ok, all right. See you later.
JIM: All right, take care.
MICHAEL: Back to work.
Cut to Angela, pointing to Kevin that he has something on his face
Cut to Jan, entering
MICHAEL: (talking to Camera) Corporate really doesn't interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan, hello! I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton, right? Not to her face because, not because I'm scared of her, because I'm not, but yeah.
Cut to Jan, Michael and Pam, sitting in Michael's office
JAN: All right, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
MICHAEL: Me no get an agenda.
JAN: I'm sorry, what?
MICHAEL: I didn't get any agenda.
JAN: Oh I faxed one over to you this morning.
MICHAEL: Really? Cause I didn't... (to Pam) did we get a fax this morning?
PAM: Yeah, the one...
MICHAEL: Why isn't it in my hand? Because a company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem Pam, why didn't I get it?
PAM: You put it in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
MICHAEL: Yeah, that was a joke, that was actually my brother's, it was supposed to be with bills and doesn't work great with faxes.
JAN: Do you want to look at mine? (hands agenda to Michael)
MICHAEL: Yeah. Thank you.
JAN: Ok since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided that we can't justify Scranton branch and the Stanford branch. Michael don't panic--
MICHAEL: Oh ok. No, No no no no this is good, this is fine.
JAN: Michael listen, don't panic. We haven't made any decisions yet, I've spoken to Joshua in Stanford I've told him the same as you, and it's up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
MICHAEL: Ok no problem.
JAN: This does however mean that there is going to be downsizing.
MICHAEL: Me no wanna hear that Jan, because downsizing is a bitch, it is a real bitch, and I wouldn't wish that on Joshua's men, I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men, or women present company excluded sorry. Is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Cut to Dwight, tapping on Jim's right shoulder (while standing left from him.) Jim looks to the right and Dwight walks away laughing
Cut back
MICHAEL: Question: how long do we have to (phone rings) Oh, Todd Packer, terrific rep, do you mind if I take it?
JAN: No, go ahead.
MICHAEL: (picks up) Pac man!
PACKER: Hey, big queen!
MICHAEL: Oh, that's not appropriate.
PACKER: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
MICHAEL: I don't know what you mean.
PACKER: Look, I've been meaning to ask her one question. ""Does the carpet match the drapes?""
MICHAEL: (hangs up) Oh my god! That's so horrifying! Horrible Horrible person!
JAN: So do you think we can keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
MICHAEL: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.
Cut to the office, Ryan just arrived and Michael walks to him
PAM: This is Mister Scott.
MICHAEL: Guilty, Guilty as charged.
RYAN: Ryan Howard from the temp agency, set me down to start today
MICHAEL: Howard, like Moe Howard, Three Stooges? Right here, my vibe. (imitates Moe, high fives Ryan) Oh Pam, that's a guy thing Pam. I'm sort of a student in comedy. Watch this, here I go. (imitates Hitler) I'm Hitler, Adolf Hitler
Cut to Pam, talking to the Camera
PAM: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go. Because then I might It's just, I don't think it's many girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations, mostly water color, a few oil pencil. Jim thinks they're good.
Cut to Pam's desk
PAM: (on phone) Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.
Cut to Jim's desk
JIM: (on phone) Sure, Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, some just came up, two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?

JIM: What are you doing?
DWIGHT: Just clearing my desk, I can't concentrate
JIM: It's not on your desk.
DWIGHT: It's overlapping. It's all coming over the edge. One word, two syllables : demarcation.
Cut to Jim's desk, he's put pencils between their desks as a fence. Dwight arrives
DWIGHT: You can't do that.
JIM: Why not?
DWIGHT: Safety violation, I could fall and pierce an organ.
JIM: (crosses fingers) We'll see (Dwight smashes all the pencils away with his phone) (to camera) This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Cut to Dwight, talking to the Camera
DWIGHT: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here even brought it up on my interview. I say, bring it on!
Cut to Pam's desk, Michael is standing there

Tries to leave as Six Million Dollar Man
PAM: What?
MICHAEL: Come on. Six million dollars man, Steve Austin, actually that would be a good salary for me don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan: I deserve a raise
PAM: Don't we all?
MICHAEL: I'm sorry?
PAM: There's nothing!
MICHAEL: If you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR, ok? Not today, ok? Pam just, be professional.
Cut to Michael, talking to the Camera
MICHAEL: I think I'm a role model here, I think I garner other people respect.
Cut to the office
MIICHAEL: Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP
Cut back to Michael
MICHAEL: People I respect, heros of mine, would be Bob Hope, Abraham Lincoln, definitely, Bono, and probably God be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world, in so many ways, that it's, it's really beyond words. It's really uncalculable.
Cut to the conference room
MICHAEL: Now, I know there's some rumors out there, and I just kind want to see'.

My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17%, or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy, a first job in the country, barely spoke English, came to me and said ""Mr Scott, would you be the Godfather to my child?"" Wow, wow, wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.

All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Lady,Brett Young,"I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady"
Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

Oh-oh
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Ooh
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again"

Good 4 U,Olivia Rodrigo,"(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby

Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,"Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
Can you kiss me more?

All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

Drivers License,Olivia Rodrigo,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh

How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise

Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart

Enough For You,Olivia Rodrigo,"I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someonе more exciting
The nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back
Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

And don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
Then you'll be the one who's crying

Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you, oh
No, nothing's enough for you"
Happier,Olivia Rodrigo,"We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons

Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?

Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it

Favorite Crime,Olivia Rodrigo,"Know that I loved you so bad

The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line

I wondеr if you're around

Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces

Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

Anyone, anyone else

Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too

Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy

Hope Ur OK,Olivia Rodrigo,"I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close
Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay"

I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah

I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules

Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' fourties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim

Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new

Wockesha,Moneybagg Yo,"Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"

Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view


We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view
A Hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A Hell of a view"

The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"

I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby)

Telepatia,Kali Uchis,"Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

pov,Ariana Grande,"It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you

Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)

I'd love to see me from your point of view

I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)

Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)

Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent

Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature

If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Hearts breakin'

I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah)
Bae gave it to me (Hmm)
You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stomp my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

On Me,Lil Baby,"(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip

Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec

We're Good,Dua Lipa,"I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good"
Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
I've been gone
Gone"
Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes"
Settling Down,Miranda Lambert,"Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds

95.south,J Cole,"100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams ""The Battlefield""""The Battlefield"" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience ""H20""98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean ""Don't Play""97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples ""Rain""96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA ""West Savannah""95. Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins	ft Joey Bada$$ ""Jerome""93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q ""2 On""92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens ""Better In Tune With The Infinite""91. Big K.R.I.T. ""King Of The South""90. PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought ""The Imperial""85. O.T Genasis	""CoCo""BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy ""Nate""83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign ""Deliver""82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West ""Can't Stop""81. Future ft. Andre 3000 ""Benz Friends (Whatchutola)""80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj ""***Flawless Remix""78. ScHoolboy Q ""Prescription/Oxymoron""77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Mamacita""76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q ""I Just Wanna Party""75. Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods	""Sunday Candy""The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.
Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion
One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room
Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release
The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""
Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind."
Your Power,Billie Eilish,"Try not to abuse your power

Made For You,Jake Owen,"Water towers are made for hearts and names
Friday nights are made for football games
Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in
Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

Smoky bars are made for ""How 'bout a dance?""
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you"
Sun Goes Down,Lil Nas X,"I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

Ha-ah, ha-ah, no-ah"
4 Da Gang,42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch,"You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K"
Maybach,42 Dugg ,"(Dee, you poppin' your shit, nigga)
(G, I think we got one)
Only love I ever felt was for my mama, on my mama
Miss my grandma, miss my uncle
Rest in peace Neff and Rece
Cash out, thick bitch from the Westside
Cash, dawg, no, this is not a S-Class
Maybach, I been turnin' up for my city
I been turnin' up for my city

Richie Rich, fuck her, then I leave, bitch, ain't no, ""Give me kiss""
All or nothin', freak bitch call me Dugg and I don't call her number
She finessin', baby, I need a dime
Baby, I need a, yeah, leave a message
Dawg, you known for doggin' hoes
Bae, I can't fuck all them hoes
Take her shoppin', she bе fly
Hermes, Chanel, and Prada
Gucci coat matchin' my mama's
'21, brand nеw, no mileage
Fuck me before I start wildin'
Calm me down
Sixes, brown, tickin' bomb
Sippin' Dom Pérignon
Bitches fine, glizzy, nine
Play and get shot
I'm still missin' my pops
When is you gettin' out?
I been turnin' up for my city (Turn me up)
I been turnin' up for my city
Tell Dess make me some noodles
Turn my young bitch to a shooter
Damn, I miss OG Double, taught me how to pimp and hustle
I go and hit a lick, you can go and ask Bubba
Big blocks, tote real choppers
Whole lotta shooters, you don't want no problems
R.I.P. Junebug, taught me in the broad day
Tryna pay this lawyer for my lil' ones, gon' be a cold case
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
One thing I never seen was a bitch that leave
Every time I crank the car, I don't use a key
Push-start, foreign whip
Two glizzies, extended clips
I don't go a day bein' sober
Pour a lotta dope in my soda
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
Sixes brown, tickin' bomb, sippin' Dom Pérignon
Big ridin', really, I'm a don
Made these bitches wait in line
I done came out the muddy
I done put the most white diamonds on the blackest hoes

I'm just turnin' up for my city (Turn me up)
I'm just turnin' up for my city
I'm just turnin' up for my city (Turn me up)
I been turnin' up for my city
Grandma, daddy, mama, sister, I been through so much lately
Run it up and stash it, damn near two million on that mattress
CMG, that's who I signed to, but I like my pockets full
I got my game from the streets, I barely went to school
I know nine Dugg, slow down, shawty
Four times, I don't really like to squash
On my daddy, on my mama
I don't really like to squash"

Minimum Wage,Blake Shelton,"Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' up with the Jones'
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money

interlude,J Cole,"Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"
applying.pressure,J Cole,"Presidential Rollie that's Obama
My shooting hand that's Osama
I'm making moves for my mama
And I'm sacrificing for the commas
Sacrifice for the commas x4
Giving orders like I'm major payne
She say I'm dripping like I came out the rain
They didn't expect me to come up
Now I'm out here doing major things
They tried to play me like I was a lame
Now I look back like ain't nothing the same
And now I'm thinking bout trying to make it for my wife and kids call me damon wayans
Up late really thinking
Thinking like whats beneath ya?
Steady thinking bout the franklins
And I ain't talking bout Aretha
I sacrifice to make it happen
Them late nights was my teacher
They taught me to keep rapping
Now everybody want a feature
I'm praying harder than the preacher
That pain you can't let it defeat ya
Lil shawty bad but she'll deceit ya
Dead presidents call me the reaper
Was slept on but never the sleeper
And I'm blessed so I gotta be the believer
And I'm trying to change the game
But you can't hate from the bleachers
Presidential Rollie that's Obama
My shooting hand that's Osama
I'm making moves for my mama
And I'm sacrificing for the commas
Sacrifice for the commas x4
Going stupid but I talk clever
I'm Mickey the way I'm getting to the cheddar
Keep applying pressure the time to stop is never
I came along way shawty I'm trying to do better
Got more flavor than a black and mild
Call me penny the way I'm making my mama proud
Up so high you could never ever bring me down
Just wish my grandma could jus see me now
Only stop for a minute like an elevator
Cuz I keep stepping forward like an escalator
And I put my licorice in her reese cup
Cuz it treat her like my now and later
Its like back to school the way I'm getting to the paper
And I mess with meek cuz I'm a dreamchaser
J Cole told me don't be heroic cuz if she don't want to do better than you can't save her
All these people watching me like the superbowl
Told the bank teller that I can't be told
Cuz I prefer the bag over the bankroll
Cuz even though the money we don't ever fold
Jayy going on another level
Told icebox I need another bezel
My wrist looking like an icicle
Been wanted the lambo since the days with the bicycle
Presidential Rollie that's Obama
My shooting hand that's Osama
I'm making moves for my mama
And I'm sacrificing for the commas
Sacrifice for the commas x4"

I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me

Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place

Single Saturday Night,Cole Swindell,"I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys

Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin' you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you

Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasn’t looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for


Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little, shook me all night long

You talkin' like you play wit' birds?
Nigga, ya dead homies got what they deserved
I came to Compton just to spit in ya mother mouth and smoke my favorite herb
Now you in front of the judge and you don't play with verbs
Stupid nigga got convicted for everything he was up against
Y'all tryin' to convince me that he got a way with words
Man my shit is real and you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick! And let these people believe them lies
Nigga time!
Nigga that shit was fire!
For real, he was spittin' some retarded shit
Up here dressed like a 'How To Be A Crip' starter kit
Nigga you'se a bitch!
Do somethin', I'll really shoot somethin'
Cross my line, and I'll shut the Volume down like a mute button
Nigga you stuntin'
I liked you better back in them Grind Time mode
But this the URL, this my shit now
And ever since I been the Champ, all these niggas want smoke
I don't see no lies told
Ask Smack
Soon as these niggas come to the crib, I'm the first thing they ask about like the wi-fi code
Nigga y'all like hoes, be in ya inner circle's whisperin' 'bout me
'Til you meet me and realize you just a 300 and I'm a Bentley
Breakfast Club ass niggas, y'all see (C) Da God and envy
You be on D shit, shout out to them Damu's
Y'all know how we do
My real niggas know if I holla ""Asante""
See now if he knew, he would've hollered out """"
But see that's why I got a question Crippin', this a lesson given
You need to figure out if gang bangin' was yo' best decision
See the west is listenin'
Just like we supposed to, cause you from New Jersey and Grape Street
So do you got a problem with the east coast too?
Cause Grape Street beef wit' the east coast, but you from the east coast
Ain't that like a conflict of interest?
I guess what's happenin' in Watts ain't none of y'all niggas business
Y'all niggas bitches, you a hoe Ars'
Gotti let the fo' spark
Catch him in his whip, I'll turn that bitch to a go kart
Headshot, need the locks on the do'; I'm Joe Clark
You don't want no part
I already bodied Suge, now Arsonal comin' straight for a vengeance
It ain't jelly when I say I got some artificial Grapes on my biscuits
Y'all be my witness
I'ma need two caskets, Red can get it too since you yappin'
But his apple in a box with the Grapes, it's a fruit basket
Nigga I'm spazzin', Gotti got the juice now
Mix Red's blood on top of Grapes and make it Fruit Town
Nigga you clowns, I'm a real nigga, that shit ain't on me, bitch the shit in me
Gun under the chin, leave a hole that exit out the top, that shit a chimney
It offend me, when you be actin' like you from them JD projects, but ain't put on none of them niggas
But you on the rap game makin' money for one of JD's projects
But I guess, I'll let the .40 bank heads, that's if he outta line
Lemon squeeze in his face, it's our (sour) time
The bottom line, I got a lot of ways I can murder him
If I'm choosing where to shoot, I'ma pick his locks like a burglary
The nerve of me, I'm back on that dumb shit
Hand gun with the drum clip, I'm dumpin' the .40, I want a young bitch
Nigga, one hit, will have his mind gone, he brain dead
Now a machine help him with his words like Rhymezone
Nigga we in different time zones
I'm on that Pacific time, grippin' mine
If this don't work, Twork voice, I got a bigga .9
This a crime
I was in jail when my patna got shot, DOA
I'm talkin' he didn't get away to the doctor
I came home to put in work for him, feelin' just like Meek in a helicopter
Cause I got out and went straight to a chopper
You in the face of a mobster!
I'll have every nigga here stretch him
Pistol whip, blunt force to the face, this peer pressure
These niggas talkin', well I'ma keep on talkin'
Nina sparkin', I've been on so many missions, bitch I'm tired of guns, I got heat exhaustion
This nigga's a fuckin' bus driver
Rappin' gangsta shit
I don't believe the nonsense, I'll show up to your job and pop on campus, it's a parent teacher conference
Nigga we believe in violence
I'll catch ya bitch and let the lead pop
All I heard was ""ooh"" ""ah"" ""eh"" before the headshot
The same bitch with different Screams; Sidney Prescott
The TEC's cocked, I get ya granny goin' to bed, put the silencer on it so the sound gone
If I let it spray, think ""graduation day"", that old bitch gettin' caped wit' her gown on
You a clown bro, Shoebox saved you in Detroit, that's the only reason you around us bro
I came from shootouts, bustin' 'til there ain't shit comin' out this hoe
I'm sayin', we both been saved by the Cal' befo'
And when it's-
Y'all can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time
Nigga suck my dick! For the second time
And now I said it to your face Crip
This like workplace harassment
I violate all your personal space bitch
I'm that cousin always on punishment, I'm not the nigga you can play wit'
So what I'm from the east nigga, gang bangin' is gang bangin', we on the same shit
I ain't new to this, I've been bangin' half my life, you must be misinformed
Oh I get it, I hardly, it hardly rain in southern California so you think we weather a different storm
Y'all know why me and this Ray Swag in the face ass nigga ain't never gon' get along?
Because you'd rather go to jail than break yo' mama heart showin' you tough, provin' some other niggas wrong
You still tryin' to prove you tough when you ride wit' yo' city
You said it yo'self you in the Grandee's 24/7 nigga
So when you gonna spend some time wit' yo' kids?
Yo youngest son really miss his daddy
And yo' patna teachin' him how to hold a gun
It's funny you spent more time in jail with yo' bunkie, but didn't spend that much time outside wit' yo' oldest son
See, who don't spend time wit' they kids, I don't support those
It's my job to fire, and leave you dead in your ""showin' up to court clothes.""
Niggas who think they Nutty on my Blocc, I extort those
All you hear is a loud BANG, remind you of how that county cell door close
Gettin' locked up is easy nigga
I can do some shit right now that's gon' land me in jail
Why is it so hard for you niggas to realize bein' absent from your kids life will leave them damaged as well?
You out here glorifyin' incarceration, this nigga scared to get mail
Nigga I give you five years tops 'til you and your oldest son together sharin' a cell
Nigga what?!
You think that jail shit scare me now?
Naw, what's scary is bein' the only nigga free in yo' hood and you gotta take care of all of yo' homies' families now
I'm on the phone with my nigga that's never comin' home
Tellin' him I just let his granny down
Nigga I come to Cali just to walk on yo' grass pussy, you Stanley now
Nigga you gon' meet karma
My hands speak fast and my reach longer
I never went to prison and I stayed free, so who really been on these streets longer?
Oh, oh oh, I'll slap this bitch, now it's gettin' domestic
You standin' there wit' yo' head down and yo' hands behind yo' back
You that used to gettin' arrested?
All that time you spent away from your two boys? I blame the game for it
But God already made him pay for it
They gave him life in the insane asylum, and they assigned him to the A. Ward
I'ma be straight forward, I'ma son of a gun, my mama was ratchet
But she told me, ""Never speak about ya pops.""
I ain't never tell on a soul, nothin' to speak about the cops
You got one style of rap nigga, you don't speak about a lot
But I get it, you wrote all your bars in prison you don't really know how to think outside the box
Nigga ya whole life was tied to the system
Stupid, you always guilty, DUH
That's why you rhyme with conviction
You look the part so ya lines in convincin'
Low cut, fucked up teeth Crip
Nigga you match beyond the description
And the nigga on Youtube, he got- he- he like, ""Yo, welcome to my hood. This the trap trap
The building over there on 165 and 166, oh that's where they make the packs at
Oh yeah that alley over there when the cops run down it's where we throw the straps at.""
Dispatch on the other line like, ""10-4 did you catch that?""
He ain't done he still goin', he said, ""Yo aye cuz, this wall right here cuz, it's full of dead homies I wish I could bring back to life
Lil' Half A Slice, on Nutty man he was a killer. He lived the savage life.""
He said, ""Aye cuz, what he'd kill, 'bout ten niggas before he made the sacrifice?""
Nigga you tellin' everything, you out here gettin' niggas indited in the after-life
Ya name ""Bay Loc""
You a fat Derrick Rose, man you gon' stay broke
And a victim of the system
No anesthesia through this incision, we need you to stay woke
Nigga, I'm here to snatch every bit of saliva out ya bae throat
Hit once then make the bitch disappear like she Def Loaf
Now between me and Gotti, it's a distance
You from where gang bangin' originated, so why I'm
{Stream cuts out}
Between me and Gotti it's a distance
Cause you went from where gang bangin' originated, but I'm more world wide known for this Crippin'
I'm Crip, you gon' be disabled there's a difference
Your bitch gotta take my dick twice a day after she eat, my shit prescription
Some shit'll never change, I'm super Crip
In my car I got the handicap sign up and everythang
That mean I get to park closer to ya job givin' me the aim
Dessy rang, I'm hittin' innocent by-standards,  I ain't got deadly aim
So I cut him in slow-mo
Word to Dobo, I put that on everythang
I go berserk on him
Bury his body I throw the dirt on him
I set him up, I had my unemployed bitch throw the work on him
Catch ya spirit headed to the afterlife, I throw the scope on him
But I ain't pull the trigger, old fashioned ass whoopin'
Beat him wit' the stick until it broke on him
He a rat, I put the cheese on his head like he from Green Bay
You the man? Well not 'round here, nigga Dikembe
Boy, the way I do you with this fourth and inches, just watch the replay
I'ma keep on cuttin' him and bringin' him back like I was a DJ
I'll put the muzzle on it, then I aim .9
What that mean? I kill him and give that moment of silence at the same time
As long as he get hospitalized tonight, I'll remain calm
Cause honestly, Gotti he could Die Another Day word to James Bond
My shit is real, you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick and let these niggas believe yo' lies
Nigga time!

All these, behind bars bars, was the type of shit you had niggas laughin' 'bout
I find it funny, how you could condemn me cause I'm goin' to jail for the shit you be rappin' 'bout
I got you niggas bangin' again
If y'all wasn't doin' it then, nigga don't be doin' it now
Tryin' to show me you gangsta, only make me think you niggas clowns
Even the vets, talk all that shit about the PG process
Then get on the card with me and all of a sudden it's the Proving Grounds
Nigga, you'se a clown
You was a Blood I heard that turned Grape Street
That's some weird shit
I knew he was a fag, cause only queers switch
Nigga real shit, you a bitch in the streets but you wanna be a Crip in the ring
Arm to his chest, look like his shit in a sling
This bitch wit' a beam
I'll steam his face, nigga I'll kill ya kid, now you a seedless Grape
Ain't no need to hate nigga, y'all straight bitches
The only battle rappers from Grape Street, is Aktive and Dre Vishiss
Tryin' to act like Grape a hood that you love
You givin' him three up top but you never booked him on UDubb!
Nigga, I'm disrespectful just like cuz, except the bars heavy
I'll kidnap ya daughter, you find her Trapped In The Closet wit' R. Kelly
Yeah I'm disrespectful, you ain't gon' do a damn thang 'bout it
I'll kill that lil' bitch, show up to her funeral, get her obituary, make a paper plane out it
Yo' little girl, that's ya world? You better keep her out my way aight
I usually don't hit kids, but today I might
Choke her, 'til you got a Blueface baby, 'Yeah Aight'
You goddamn right, I'll put the blade to his daughter's scalp
Make sure that lil' bitch in pain
How the fuck y'all callin' Arsonal ""Da Rebel"" but I'm the one goin' against the grain
This shit insane
Ya baby mama look good, ooh them tits soft
After I fuck her I use his daughter clothes to wipe my dick off
I'm disrespectful, I'm tryin' to figure him out
I hope on them field trips they say, ""This dude nuts""
I hope on them field trips you catch yo' daughter givin' head on the back of ya school bus
This dude nuts
I been tryin' to figure him out
I seen his daughter, I said ""You would never succeed (suck seed) until somebody bust they kids in ya mouth!""
Look what he did for the clout!
He been rappin' like that 15+
I can't remember a time he was lyrical
The King Of Disrespect? He ain't got enough respect for the craft to write fire material
I'm tired of hearin' you
I don't even think you no real nigga, I can tell by yo' demeanor
You became a bus driver cause you ain't have the smarts to be a teacher
Nigga you a leecher
Ride every nigga wave that you close to
Scream Fetty Wap name all last year, he ain't even post you
You a weirdo
Portrayed to be a Loc by your peers though
I know ya fears bro
You wear that purple flag so in Cali you got a spot for protection
But tell these niggas how when you in Cali you scared to even go to ya section
Nigga look in the mirror
I be he see a hoe in the reflection
I'm talkin' real shit, ain't nothin' outta context
If he wasn't a rapper, he wouldn't have even stepped foot in them projects
But I guess, he better be glad he can rap
Cause you ain't no shooter from them Bricks, that's an actual fact
But since you can rap and you bangin' they shit puttin' 'em on
They let him do it, they just gotta tax you for that
It's tax season! The whole projects claimin' him as a dependent
Payin' grown men for protection, that gotta be weird
Tell Suge he should be cool showin' up now, they show love to big bitches 'round this time of the year
We not the same!
I really had to put in work for my name
True story, I done really put niggas on shirts for the game
This nigga made a game; Arsonal's Revenge
(Aye, for real they gon' buy that shit)
Arsonal's Revenge, aye but that don't mean he 'bout his business or his wealth
It's just like I been tellin' y'all
He good at creatin' an image for himself
Yeah you bang Grape Street but in Watts you be scared faggot, I know ya story
Can't show up to the projects without a care package
Every time he come over there, shit be feelin' like Christmas
Got him givin' out money and free Fetty Wap tickets
How he talkin' Grape Street like he really wit' that
If he was, how come when Suge got robbed he ain't get his shit back?
Grape Street that nigga, Grape Street this
Them niggas took ya phone and ya motherfuckin' jewelry, you ain't been back on Grape Street since
He had trouble wit' that
Brand new .50, I can't even feel the kickback
This a clean cal', you can tell by the Gun Title it got a Double Impact
Nigga if you ain't shootin' shit, you can't even talk to Gotti
I'm a walkin' homi
Nigga believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
They prolly don't even understand what I'm talkin' prolly
Cause the news said I dropped a nigga, that was a lie
I caught the body!
And when it's real, y'all tell
(You can see it in they eyes
Go head, it's yo' turn, make them nigga believe them lies
Nigga time)

Nigga suck my dick! Third times a charm
I thought you would've swung by now
This nigga ain't got no fight left in him, he like, ""He already won by now.""
I admire you knowin' you couldn't beat me but him still try
But you popped up at the wrong time, that's an in-field fly
Meaning ya hitter out immediately
Ya runners? Lookin' hesitant
12, 13, 14 letters of the alphabet, Gotti you way outta ya element
Get ya bars up, I don't get stuck in the moment, I'll leave a star struck
Serve him through the window early morn', ""Welcome to Starbucks""
Gun spark, light flash, you think a photo man behind ya
No! Tommy in his face barkin' in his face like, ""I don't know no damn Kiana.""
I'ma be real wit' niggas
Smack and Beasley, they tryin' to build a nigga
Code word 
They fly me in to give a meal (mil') to niggas
Telekinesis powers when I'm mad, I Matilda niggas
I got still for niggas, meet my New Edition, I'm Johnny Gill wit' niggas
BOOM! Through ya front door, knock ya bitch up, then pick her up
Put the deuce to his head like I was tryin' to fuck the picture up
Show up to the funeral, reach in the casket and grab ya sister butt
Cause my first name ""I Don't"", last name ""Give A Fuck""
AKA Durrell ""Disrespectful"" Jones
I'm not ya friend brother
I'll slap the dog shit outta you and ya friend mother
How many times you copped out at court? Let's not pretend brother
You would've been a house nigga, and I can tell by ya skin color
Nigga my tool is chunky, ya father fell in love with a foolish junkie
I stay ten toes down with my fuckin' chin up, I don't care who confront me
You a flunky and ya whole hood green
That's why ya son remind me of the lil' nigga H&M had referred to as the ""coolest monkey""
I wish I was the doctor standin' in-between ya bitch legs when she was givin' birth
Cause that would've solidified my spot as the one nigga who get to smack that lil' nigga first
Yeah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
You want a birth death?
I almost kill him on purpose just to say him and watch him struggle through his first breaths
Soon as the nigga 'bout to walk, I clip him before he take his first steps
Him and his other brother, they competin' who gon' have the worst death
Rebel shit
This level of success, you will never get
Special Olympics, I'm here to show y'all who the better Crip
Grape Street, we the gang
Speak in vain, heaters bang
We Crippin' form a different point of view, we don't see the same
Nigga, to me you still a tiny Loc nigga
So take this L and let that L sit
You came in here lookin' for Ars' and got Durrell bitch
I'm quick to let a shell kick
For goin' against the grain, what I'm raising (raisin) will put a Nut' in the bag we makin' trail mix
But you don't even think like that
Last night in Le Palace you yellin', ""Anything possible"" and you don't even drink like that
I'll walk up in ya son's school
Go to the oldest lil' nigga class
Rex ad lib, yell ""That nigga dead!"" when he say he miss his dad
Man, in front of his classmates I'll fuckin' whip his ass
Man, and then walk downstairs and tell ya younger son, ""Go stand in the street in front of that hell cat.""
Then I did the dash
Y'all wanna know what happened next?
I hit his ass!
I knocked him so far back he flew into the Ghost Of Christmas Past
Last time the nigga seen his daddy, he had to kiss the glass
Next time gon' be to identify him and zip the bag
I said, my bitch toughened up
I ain't gotta shoot or do an uppercut
Code word: Orgasm
(What that mean?)
She was trained to squirt and bust a Nut'

Talk naaasty!

He said, she said, I don't care what niggas said 'bout him
One day he true blue, BAOW! Next mornin' niggas read (red) 'bout him (bottom)
Baow! Baow! Baow! Another one blew (blue)
Blaow! And it knocked all of the red out him
Then you gon' see a Grape Street Crip moonwalkin' through the blood just to say I did it in red bottoms
Now if I pull up, it's gon' be Glocks involved
Mops and all, I'm lettin' rockets off
{Cell phone sound} Brrrrrrrt
The doctor makin' a Compton call
Surgery! Blottin' up his exit wounds with cotton balls
You just sell wigs, I get paid to knock 'em off!
I said, is we talkin' colors here? Or your profession and how you color hair?
I'll slap ya nephew in front of ya mother to see if ya brother care
Somebody please dare me to do it
(I dare you)
Do I hear a double dare?
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
Ya bitch mouth had my finger, dick and balls in it
She did it in front of ya house and didn't even give a fuck, cause the car tinted
We had a gang bang last night...she was involved in it
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

Last round it's on-

Nah, sike I lied nigga
No, sike I lied nigga
Sike you died nigga
You made ten thousand dollars
Ten thou- man that's pocket change
You know what happened when they Dow jumped?
Man, let's just say I'm tied into the stock exchange
I mean, you said I was on tour, I was gettin' a lot of money with Fetty Wap and thangs
Where your Champion Of The Year money?
Cause I got a whole lot of gwap and thangs
You got Champion Of The Year money, why don't you put it to your ear dummy
This ""Trapion"" Of The Year money
Time nigga

Aye, y'all just seen that stack that this nigga pulled out?
That's a whole lot of money that he made from this art form
I hope after you die today, you give a little bit of that money to ya BM and ya daughter, that can be a nice lil' start for 'em
I mean you gotta give 'em somethin', cause I heard the stories
They said you barely for 'em
I'm just sayin', they bitches better pray they in ya will (wheel) like a car horn
Nitty already buried Suge
Now these niggas finna get a casket together
Said he ain't know Shotgun...they up here rappin' together
Y'all the fakest of friends
Headshot, when I say, ""The doc tryin' to patch things up"", he ain't makin' amends
Ain't no shakin' my hand
You do a whole lotta weak shit
In the field, the strap got no safety, we in goal line defense
They said ""Bro ain't got a weakness"" that's 'til the can' clap you
Hospital beds, rubber bands wrap you
His family like, ""How he doin'?""
I don't know, he just popped up on the 'tube, he a Banned battle
Nigga I'm from Nutty Blocc, this shit deeper than just a tattoo
You slapped the hat off Iron, I'll grab the iron and slap you!
That's a fact too, you a lil' boy to me Arsonal
Gave him the .9, the .40 and then the chopper
Just thought he needed a little more in him Arsonal (arsenal)
Fuck Arsonal though, cause if Ray Swag was here I would've shot him right in front of you
I would've gave him two in his brains
Niggas would've been yellin' for you to get ya dawg (dog) like he was loose from the chain
Nigga what you do for the game?
Niggas know I be in Compton with the Crips
AK's really poppin' and shit
Marshall Lawrence, the way we had to chop into bricks
Nigga I'm hittin' licks
A young nigga, makin' racks, I'm just statin' facts
The Feds was hot, I had to play the back
I'm just sayin', the pigs was all over ya dawg (dog), I was bakin' raps (bacon wraps)
Nigga face the facts
How you supposed to be a killer, but you ain't killed nothin' or drilled nothin'?
Walked in the house with blood on my shirt, told my mama I spilled somethin'
Steel dumpin', I'm still thuggin'
If they would've got the prints off the gun I wouldn't be here
You would've seen the kid do life
But I'm way too sharp like a Ginsu knife
Blue rag over the handle, that's a cloth over the grip like the lid too tight
Nigga you too light! I really came from shootouts
Check the score nigga, we up
On the missions, we just pray we make it back like the re-up
You see us, this what real Crippin' look like
You starin' at dope when it come back cooked right
I'm talkin' in the trap
Rare Breeds, we got it brick by brick
The smokers knew it was freebase like we got hit by pitch
Nigga this my shit
And these niggas be worryin' 'bout the wrong shit
Like if we should've stopped watchin' football cause of Kaepernick
Niggas die in my hood everyday, news just don't capture shit
Celebrities could talk about it, we just want 'em to do it
Crazy, while you was busy boycottin' the NFL my boy caught a bullet
I rep the gang to the fullest
I'm talkin' 'bout we shootin' 'til the lead gone
Tell the youth
""Ain't nothin' in this lifestyle but death. That's the truth.""
I be prayin' I was dead wrong
But where I'm from, when you be too hard headed, you end up a head stone
I'm from the streets, that's what they made sidewalks fo'
Niggas done really died on my block
Even standin' too close to the curb will get a nigga hit, we playin' sideline pop
Nigga I'm from the streets for real, they- aye ask about me in my hood
I was a young nigga, lettin' that lead fly shorty
I'm talkin' 16 fuckin' wit' a .40
Tell Lifetime I'm ready to tell my story
Survivin' the streets, if y'all would've seen what I seen, maaan, y'all prolly wouldn't have made it out
I'm tellin' you, this shit prolly would've made cuz quit
So many homies in the cemetery it's like they workin' graveyard shift
Nigga and I peep my nigga Knocca, sometimes I be wishin' I could go wit' him
So many niggas I done lost, I ain't got no mo' love in my heart
{Takes off his shoe}
Even my shoe ain't got a sole (soul) in 'em
Nigga every strap, got a pole in 'em
Two shots, that's why I clapped him
Another shot, body bagged him
Cause the third rounds just hit harder like when I be rappin'
It's a real life struggle everyday in the trenches
.40 goin' over my options, I'm tryin' to make a decision
Nigga Roc voice, ""It's me dawg.""
I'm from Nutty Blocc, hub in the dub, Watts
Nigga I show love to my Grape Street so free 03 and free Hogg
And when it's real y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
(Go 'head)
See if he can believe them lies
Nigga time"

Hold On,Justin Bieber,"You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on (Hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (Away, yeah)
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh-woah)
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way

Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Hold on)
Tell me everything that you need to say

All I Know So Far,P!nk,"Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway

I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth

You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far

So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line

You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far

That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far

I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up
Yeah
When it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up
'Til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far

That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far

I will be with you 'til the world blows up, hm"
Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"
Follow You,Imagine Dragons,"You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepеst low
I'll always be around wherevеr life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here coming through)

I will follow you way down wherever you may go (I'll follow you)
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you (I'll follow you)
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da

Way Less Sad,AJR,"I should move
'Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low

I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad

And I'm not so mad at Twitter now
Living sucks
But it's sucking just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more

And I'm trying too hard, but I can't not try
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind

Drankin N Smokin,Future & Lil Uzi Vert,"Saggin' out the malls, we do the most, oh
Had a ratchet in my coat, got a girl doin’ coke

We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look

Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah

My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean

It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, ""Girl, I creamed""
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?

Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

Oh-oh
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
""Man, it feels good to be country again""

Ooh
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again"
Wasted On You,Morgan Wallen,"I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"
